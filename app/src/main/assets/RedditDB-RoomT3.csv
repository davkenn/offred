I'm not going to lie, my heart was really set on having a nice VAD Roland kit but after getting scammed on eBay I think I'm sticking to buying locally. That being said, living on an island in Hawaii has my options limited.

Is this worth $1,500 to begin with?;https://i.redd.it/32fdgg1u1ht91.jpg;/r/drums/comments/y2l016/alesis_strike_pro_kit_from_marketplace/;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1dOfPmmpFcIxHawV-Aq6dzQLPpk4ethktdE4k3gCJAU.jpg

While I understand that a metronome is extremely helpful in finding the recommended BPMs for a song, the necessity of practicing along side a metronome click is much less important than feeling the way a song flows during live practice. No untrained ear will be able to actually hear any sort of minor drag or jump in speed while playing live. Most concert audiences are feeling the music emotionally rather than mathematically. Is keeping perfect time more important than keeping time the way an audience feels (or during a cover, the way the vibe of the song MAKES them feel?) Discuss. No fighting.

t3_y2hql1;t5_2qie5;1665614078000;1665623728724;Fear of electronic drums;Hello, I want to buy some drums in order to make my songs sound more natural and also because I really like playing drums (I also play other instruments, I am pretty beginner at playing drums). I have a kind of fear/repulsion for electronic ones but at the same time I live in a rented flat and the acoustic ones would rip my neighbours(even though I listen to loud music a lot without complains). Despite me liking the muffed bedroom pop sound, I bought only a snare since my buget was tight and I wanted some good rolls but it seems to be decently loud even with cloth on.

Now my buget has increased and I want to buy a full kit but I just have a repulsion for electronic ones because the ones I tested have some generic reverbed big drums and that is not the sound I want + for instance the hihat had only full closed/full open samples and I would want that intermediate as buildup +  what happens with rim.

My question is what drums would you recommend and what VST's would you recommend for a 60s,70s,muffed dry drum sound, also how the latency is on midi/usb. I need to mention that I am from eastern Europe and the buget would be like \~500$;https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/y2hql1/fear_of_electronic_drums/;/r/drums/comments/y2hql1/fear_of_electronic_drums/;self
t3_y2kfqi;t5_2rukl;1665621133000;1665623728731;Went 6 weeks clean for job search, had a joint last Friday, was out my system in under two days (50 ng/ml test). Is this something I can do ONCE a week to where it's out my body by the time Monday comes around? Looking for a balance to offset evening's lack of appetite and night's intrusive thoughts;*tl;dr is the title, so feel free to disregard all of this below as it's a LOT*

Moved to a legal state sometime ago and really fell in love with cannabis beverages. Tastes delicious, got me high quicker than your typical edible, lasted longer than a non-edible high. Did it daily, though more so on the weekend and only at nights as I don't like being high during the day. Due to work, I started getting prescribed ADHD meds which worked wonders for my issues with focusing and suppressing my nonstop intrusive pessimistic thoughts that made me constantly anxious during the day. My biggest side effect is that I can straight up go past 10 PM without eating once before I get hungry, but the cannabis helped with that.

Got laid off a few months ago, but company decided to keep me on payroll for a few more months to "extend" my employment with them for my sake. Well, despite laying me off and overworking me along with 24/7 on-call that has ruined the ability for me to hear any sound notifications or be in a different room as my phone without my heart beating out of my chest. First time being laid off, hadn't had a vacation in 3+ years (and not often will I get paid by a company for this long to not work) and figured I was in a legal state as a software engineer where testing is rare (gov aside) so I should be fine but... I forgot to factor in that some remote jobs don't give a damn if you're in a legal state (be it insurance costs, invasive CEO, etc). 

About a month in, decided to quit because I could find damn near zero detailed studies on how long beverages stay in your body. By detailed, I mean in the same way there is lots of data about smoking weed and the typical methods of partaking (I LOVE reading data lol). About 3 and a half weeks later when I decided to buy some tests, tested negative.

That's great, but here I was 6 weeks in clean. Recession(?), living in a HCOL city where remote employers may not wanna pay someone a HCOL wage, waiting until just last month to start applying to hybrid jobs, not exactly the best case scenario at the moment. Not including two main problems that I had. 

* Without cannabis, my appetite is consistently absolute shit due to my meds and I can sometimes go past midnight without eating once (though if that happens I will eat a huge meal before I sleep regardless). 

* I need discipline of sorts in regards to sleep (school schedule, work schedule) because I naturally prefer being awake at night since that's ***my*** time. Once my meds wear off, all those pessimistic intrusive thoughts come roaring back in and keep me up (next day = responsibilities, interview prep = sheer dread). No amount of OTC sleep meds have helped, and while I'm able to nap well during the day on my Vyvanse, ***no chance in hell*** would I even think of doing that lmao. 

Now I do my research on these companies anyway to see if they drug test in ***any*** capacity (including outside of my role). Most companies don't (tech and all), but a few do and I keep note of that. I treat those with zero data as "yes." Since all but one company that I'm interviewing with don't drug test, and knowing that one joint would leave my body by the end of the weekend, I decided to get high to be able to finally unwind and see for myself just how long it'll stay in my body.

15 minutes in, I passed out before midnight (first time sleeping before 3 AM since I quit cannabis) and got a full amount of sleep. Even the next day, that burnt out feeling kinda felt good honestly. My brain didn't feel like it was going "full throttle" (be it Vyvanse or ADHD intrusive thoughts), and if feeling burnt out would be "under the speed limit", it felt like combined that I was driving the speed limit. The actual day after honestly felt more relaxing than the high itself (though that was also great, I just literally slept is all lol). Less than 2 days after, I tested negative.

With that said, I've been wondering: If enough THC leaves the body for me to test negative on what would be the initial screening (which is 50 ng/ml), would doing it once every Friday night be okay? Though I was going to set a personal rule that any companies I end up in the final round with that do drug test (or who I couldn't find any confident answers about if they do or not), I would refrain going forward to be safe until I hear back. My mindset is that it's a LOT easier to manage it like this (water, exercise, etc) than if I was still a daily user.

Part of me likes gathering this data on myself for a "personal study" as it's a good basis for future reference in future job searches. But I'm the kind of person who can quit something with "justifiable reason" (money, job, military, etc), and with NO restrictions, if it doesn't affect my relationships and career, it can become a daily thing. This even extends to soda, candy, etc. if I don't have a "justifiable reason" to stop (i.e. cavities, grocery costs, etc).  

At the same time it really did feel nice to just truly unwind while I continue to get frustrated with myself for being so picky with the job search. Granted I was so overworked and stressed at my last job that prior to layoffs I had only explored my new city once while starving myself throughout the work day for a company that threw me out like trash, so I do have reasons for being picky. But it's still getting to me and having me feel like a failure, even without the intrusive thoughts hammering down on me.  

I digress, but either way I'd refrain from cannabis beverages (lack of data) until I'm back in the workforce and stick with non-edible methods in the meantime. I'm very much curious about being able to find a healthy medium, but if it's the accumulation of THC that makes it last longer in a daily user's body, it's the remnants between 15-50 ng/ml that I'm curious about.

So about this guy with 99 games and 100% winrate :)

Lets say he is right . Is it still fair if someone who has 3500 elo on main creates a new 1000 elo account and farm elo for his premades ? how is this fair for us to lose elo like that vs accounts like that ?

P.S 1 : We lost to them so now he has 100 games and 100% winrate !

P.S 2 : We all had 1000+ games in faceit . IDK why we even matchup against such accounts ???

When in game, some of us lagging and some of us just crashing in the important rounds. I had that thing twice as i said and once in mirage once in dust 2 one month ago. But in my latest game of mirage it was much more weirder because on the dust 2 we were all laging when close to enemy but in mirage it wasnt a lag of all players it was just in the important situations. Its just like server is going for totally and you need to restart your game or even anticheat. restarting your internet doesnt fix it because its not clientsided for %100.

t3_y2k1dc;t5_2wktw;1665620051000;1665623729009;Lockpicking realism and suggestions;As someone who picks locks for a living, I have mixed feelings on the lockpicking mechanic. I feel like it's a small enough fraction of my job that I'm not way better than a random survivor the way a hobbyist might be, and I have a pretty good idea of what it's like to pick locks on random doors in real life with time pressure, so hopefully this is fairly useful feedback. 

Good:

- The proficiency model works pretty well here in that there are a lot of locks, especially on residential buildings, that can be raked open really quickly without much effort, but single pin picking is much harder (at least for me) and will work on a wider variety of locks. 

- Sometimes two identically designed locks can be drastically different to pick because of bitting, condition, etc., and that feels well represented by the randomness in the game. It would be great to see easier locks on houses and more difficult ones on businesses, but I assume that would require a bunch of work that's not really worth it. 

- Immobilizers genuinely make it much harder to steal modern cars than older ones, and that's a really good thing to model. 

Bad: 

- Picks break way too often. I think I've broken one pick in the my entire life, and that was in my first month as a locksmith. Obviously we can make some allowances considering the tools are usually improvised and the survivor is a beginner, but at least in my experience it only took one time to figure out how much force was too much.

- Jammed locks are another thing that feels weird in the game. They are a real thing and I do a lot of extractions after people mess up their locks trying DIY fixes, but for that exact reason I feel like it makes sense to have extraction be an option, possibly gated behind the locksmith proficiency or locksmith kit item. Safes and doors should probably share behavior on this, too.

Suggestions: 

- If we're imagining just the handle being locked in some of these scenarios, latch slipping would be a great feature to add. It's much faster than picking and, perhaps most importantly, would finally create a use for those Foodplace loyalty cards. It's also a case where tool wear is a significant factor; I would say I only get 50-100 uses out of a card depending on how tight the frame is.

- Alternatives for safes: I don't do safe work, but drilling should maybe be an option, again with high levels of skill. Also, a lot of cheap safes seem in homes can be opened with an angle grinder or circular saw. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff and don't necessarily expect any of this to change since I'm too lazy to learn enough to contribute, but I thought my perspective might still be valuable to someone who can.;https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/y2k1dc/lockpicking_realism_and_suggestions/;/r/cataclysmdda/comments/y2k1dc/lockpicking_realism_and_suggestions/;self
t3_y2j1op;t5_2wktw;1665617425000;1665623729009;List of Enhanced Spells;I've been having my character read spellbooks in their spare time while waiting for his genetic damage to heal enough to give him more mutagen. While I was leveling up my spells I noticed that a couple of them give you an enhanced version once you max out the level of the basic version. I looked online but I couldn't find any info about this so I thought I'd leave a post here with a list of what spells do and don't have an enhanced version.  If you happen to have anything to add to this list leave a comment and I'll update the list when I'm able.

List of Enhanced Spells:

1. Acid Resistance ---&gt; Greater Acid Resistance (Need to test this out. Not sure if it's any better or if it's just a placebo effect.)
2. Frost Armor ---&gt; Enhanced Frost Armor (Enhanced version has same stats as basic frost armor but it lasts longer, casts faster, and costs less to cast as you level it up.)
3. Feral Form ---&gt; Feral Form (Enhanced version has the same name as the basic version but it lasts longer and costs less to cast as you level it up. The casting time may speed up as you level it up but right now I'm too lazy to go looking for material components to level it past 1.)
4. Glide on Ice ---&gt; Glide on Ice (Like Feral Form, the enhanced version doesn't change the name. Unlike all other enhanced spells that I've seen, the duration of this spell lasts for an incredibly long time as you level it up. 1 additional hour per level. It also costs less to cast and casts faster as you level it.)
5. Flamesword ---&gt; Enhanced Flamesword (Same stats as basic Flamesword, lasts longer, costs less, casts faster as you level it.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's a list of spells I maxed the level on and didn't find an enhanced version.

List of non-enhanced spells:

1. Acid Bite
2. Acid Claw
3. Animated Blade
4. Aura of Protection
5. Black Dragon Breath
6. Black Dragon Shell
7. Bless
8. Burning Hands
9. Cone of Cold
10. Crystallize Mana
11. Dragon Boost
12. Dragon Terror
13. Finger Firelighter
14. Fireball
15. Flamebreath
16. Frost Spray
17. Hoary Blast
18. Holy Blade
19. Ice Shield
20. Ice Spike
21. Improved Knock
22. Magical Light
23. Mirror Image
24. Nature's Bow
25. Point Flare
26. Restoration
27. Root Strike
28. Smite
29. Spiritual Armor
30. Synaptic Stimulation
31. Tornskin

I've never needed to make a list like this before so if the way I made it looks sloppy and irks you then I apologize. Of the non-enhanced spells I feel like Spiritual Armor, Holy Blade, Nature's Bow, and Ice Shield should have enhanced versions. I updated my game mid playthrough and already had those spells above or at the current maximum so maybe they glitched out for me and you'll get an enhanced version of those spells.;https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/y2j1op/list_of_enhanced_spells/;/r/cataclysmdda/comments/y2j1op/list_of_enhanced_spells/;self

I did ramp test via zwift I think its around 200 and I've been using this to test my ftp. I did finish the build me up work out as my first structured workout (if some of you would agree) . After finishing this plan I've wanted to do the everesting via indoor trainer so i did purchased an everesting plan in trainingpeaks (10 weeks indoor plan)  i already finished this plan for around 3 times but still cant finish the whole everesting. Highest ftp I've reach via ramp test is 243. Currently im  at 235. The problem is i tested my ftp via 20 min test in zwift and it is 195. 

Im now training via periodization and now on build phase around &gt;10 hrs/week with 2 interval/wk and mostly zone 2 if there is time im doing long rides on the weekend. 
I've been using the 235 ftp. My OCCD just want to know if im on the right track.

Edit: i dont have any particular goal/event right now i just want to improve my fitness. I just want to do it right.

At 235 ftp i can do this intervals for references

I'm able to finish a 5x3 VO2 max at 115%

However, most of my weekday workouts are in the 1-1.5hour range on the trainer, and weekend rides are maybe 3-4 hours long outside.

Ideally, I consume the same gels/drink mixes indoors as I do during an event. But having 3-4 20g carb gels during my 1 hour morning workout on the trainer seems really wasteful.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys do for shorter workouts at home? Is it important to be that consistent with your gut, or can you guys usually just workout with regular food, or no food intake during an hour on the trainer, and then intake a huge amount of carbs outdoors?

It seems that Covid boosters are all supposed to be free and when I called the city they said that I "don't need insurance" to get a booster. I made an appointment at Walgreens and they told me 1. They won't take my insurance because they're not in my network and 2. If they give me the shot as if I didn't have insurance, I may get fined since I technically do have insurance, it just doesn't work with them.

t3_y25lqh;t5_2qs1t;1665585345000;1665623729342;My impressions of New York;Here are some of my impressions of New York coming from a city in the developed world as a tourist for a few weeks. 

- Too uncivilised 

People shouting in the streets. General sense of aggressiveness in some instances. Compared to other places, I felt that New York had this vibe of drama can happen at any time. You really have to be on your toes. Easy for people to be offended for little things . What happened to doing things for others such as holding the door open, letting people in need sit on the subway, asking for permission to sit next to someone especially when limited space? 

People drinking openly in public is another example. Drinking responsibly is fine but surely drinking in public brings out a host of issues. 


- Dirty

The city seems to be crumbling with lack of maintenance. Roads are dirty. Subways are dirty. Too many rats. Too much rubbish. 

- Homelessness, mental illness and general poverty

One expected inequality in distribution of wealth but I didn’t expect that in a country of America’s wealth, there would be so much inequality with beggars and mentally ill abound. The memory I have of a beggar with a sign ‘I might as well be invisible’ was poignant 

- Noisy 

The honking on the streets is crazy and almost Asian like. I come from an environment where you would be lucky to hear someone honk at you once in day. Honking should be reserved for serious misdemeanours rather than as a matter of course 

- Keep on moving 

I loved observing the ‘hustle’. There were many who would just do to make a living. From selling masks where it is compulsorily required to rickshaws to street food stalls, amazing to see the hustle 

- Confusing pricing

Don’t know why the final price isn’t disclosed on certain items. The mental gymnastics to include tax and tipping in the final price was confusing. 

- Extroverted 

Loved to see people showcasing their talent. From ice skating at the Rockerfeller Centre to dancing in Central Park, loved to see people show off what they are good at

- Music 

What is it with people carrying boom boxes around in public? It goes to civics and respect of others that you don’t play loud music in public but in New York, it’s noticeable how people just put their music on boom box in public.

- New York Museum was amazing 

- Loved the grid lay out of streets and avenues. Makes it so much easy to get around rather than having random street names. 

- Does the police even ‘police’? 

Saw a couple of instances of really uncalled behaviour like throwing glass bottles on the road right in front of the police for someone to yell out amongst the police group ‘it’s not worth it’ with the person chastising and challenging the police but the police just stood there and did nothing. I would have expect an arrest or at the bare minimum, a word by the police towards the perpetrator but nothing. I understand all the the Candy Crus and bike lane jokes but would expect the police force to enforce law and order. 

- Weed smell 

I could be wrong but what is that smell? It seems to be weed but it’s just really noticeable 

- Tipping 

Confused about when to tip and how much to tip. Some asked for a tip and some didn’t. Coming from a place where tipping is almost non-existent, this was an interesting dynamic. 

- Buildings

I am sure a tourist has not seen enough but loved the concrete jungle. Things are generally just bigger and lots of them.;https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/y25lqh/my_impressions_of_new_york/;/r/newyorkcity/comments/y25lqh/my_impressions_of_new_york/;self

Dicho esto, me incomoda un poco cuando lo primero que suena cuando alguien decide tocar ‘música criolla’ es 9 de 10 veces Contigo Peru o algo por el estilo.

Acuérdense que La música criolla en si no es un género musical particular si no una serie de distintos estilos como el vals criollo, polka, tonderos, marinera entre otros. El vals criollo siendo el rey de todos en mi humilde apreciación.

Dicho esto, hay que valorar todos los estilos de nuestra música criolla ya que con el pasar de los años se escuchan menos y menos y se va diluyendo a unos cuantos artistas más ‘modernos’ como el nombrado Zambo Cavero, con todo el respeto que se merece.

El Peru tiene de los mejores compositores de todo America, no tengo dudas. El vals criollo fue muy popular en la época de los 40, 50, 60 en países vecinos y en realidad en todo America. Argentina es conocida por el tango. Colombia por sus cumbias. Mexico por las rancheras. Peru siempre fue conocido por el vals criollo. 

Tanto que hay muchos temas compuestos por peruanos que fueron inmortalizados por artistas extranjeros.

Los artistas peruanos más destacados sin duda fueron Los Morochucos (Oscar Aviles formo parte de este trío, siendo para muchos la mejor guitarra de nuestro país) Los embajadores Criollos, Los Chamas y Los Davalos.

Estos tríos (hay varios más) para mi formaron lo que es la vieja guardia de la música criolla. Dejare unos links para los que estén interesados escuchar algunos de los mejores temas asociados con estos artistas. Seguramente reconocerán varios:

Los Chamas -
Con Locura (quizás mi canción favorita)
https://youtu.be/edcX2b5drDs

Desde que te fuiste
https://youtu.be/V-8RO5E6Nqk

El Regreso (homenaje a Arequipa. Hermosisima letra)
https://youtu.be/H6CViYvCeeI

Los Morochucos -

El Huerto de mi Amada (esa intro con la guitarra del maestro Aviles… se me aguan los ojos. Me recuerda a mis padres)
https://youtu.be/Nc29Pv1K1rQ

El Plebeyo (para mi no hay más bonita letra. Muy conocida en toda LATAM)
https://youtu.be/CcmD_37zOqs

Cuando llora mi guitarra (quien no la conoce?)
https://youtu.be/LXffeGHks8I

Palmero (canción de origen Español pero al estilo de tondero. Esta arma la jarana)

https://youtu.be/JRGawhWRySk

Hay demasiadas más. Agreguen y aporten más. Este 31 cuando estén reunidos , toquen algo distinto y a la vez conserven nuestro legado musical.

You can add multiple builders to speed up an upgrade at a depreciating value for each one. For instance an increase of 50,25,10,5 percent increase for 5 builders for a total of 90 percent increase. 

This would solve the problem of not adding too many builders into the game, as well as encouraging more active game.;https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/y2l5q9/builder_improvement_suggestion/;/r/ClashOfClans/comments/y2l5q9/builder_improvement_suggestion/;self

All great and loved it. However I met somebody and told them I needed recommendations in rock. I was recommended In Rainbows. Heard about this record a lot and it was great. Moved on to Ok Computer, again it was great. Then I got to Kid A, and just wow. That’s all I can say, I’m speechless. Kid A is my favorite out of the 3 I’ve listened to so far. And even though I’m still pretty new in rock, I think that they may be my favorite band lol. And I wanna say idioteque might be one of my favorite songs in all genres??

I don’t really know how to put this into words, but I’ve been trying to find books that don’t do whatever that type of book would do normally to convey its purpose, or just do something new.

The books that I put into this category are The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams
Thing Explainer by Randall Munroe
Nox by Anne Carson
Ship of Theseus by J. J. Abrams
Exercises in Style by 
Codex Seraphinianus by Luigi Seraph

It doesn’t have to be educational like Thing Explainer or humorous like The Meaning of Liff, and it could even have a story like Nox and Ship of Theseus.l

I am incredibly claustrophobic, and thought that these three people have really interesting stories. I'm not 100% what books would be the best to read, but I did do my research. I'll tell what books I have found, and please give me alternate options if you think they are better. Aron Ralston seems like the easiest one, he is the author of "Between a Rock and a Hard Place". There are two versions though, one was the original, but the other was released after the movie. I don't know if there is a significant difference? For Floyd Collins, there is "Trapped! the Story of Floyd Collins" which seems to be the newer and updated (and therefore probably better) version of "Trapped!: The Story of the Struggle to Rescue Floyd Collins from a Kentucky Cave in 1925 an ordeal which became on of the most sensational news events of modern times" (what is that name????).  But Floyd's brother, Homer Collins, wrote "The Life and Death of Floyd Collins" Is that a better book to read? It seems that there are no books about John Jones, but perchance there is one that I missed?

Thank you if you responded and managed to read my incomprehensible ramblings.

I understand I’m more than likely the minority here, but I’ve always been 1: a metalhead, and 2: an open minded person with a diverse friends group. 

No I will not shove any beliefs or views upon anyone(except that Ghost is superb)!

The music scene for me, mainstream anyway, is very plain, dull and lifeless. And I hate to say it, but there was even a time where blink was starting to conform to normality. PC culture has ruled with an iron fist, and Covid has numbed us. Which is nobody's fault. 

The late 90's and 2000's where people took risk's and glory days of blink, were over in my eyes. Talking about dicks and shit. Unapologetically being ourselves, and walking tall. 

But it now seems that the boys are back in town. The announcement video being focused on cumming itself is enough to give me goosebumps. That is such a statement in itself. To say fuck you to PC. Blink to me were in the same realm as South Park. They never gave a fuck and were full of humor and got away with it, then they went away.

t3_y2dkr3;t5_2xuqg;1665604253000;1665623730228;How dragons work in runeterra.;Hello there!

I have some grand theories on many things related to dragons, spirits, celestials and more in runeterra. But one huge theory will take ages and ages to research and write out, plus who has the time to read one huge essay. So I will be occasionally dropping some mini-theories, that hopefully link together and build on eachother. And every step of the way make sure to give me your thoughts so I can refine and improve my theories! And it doesn't matter if you don't read the other parts. Any and all questions, critiques and ideas will be appreciated.

In this theory, I will be categorising the various abilities of dragons and attempting to explain why they have such abilities.

# TLDR:

Elemental dragons are not natural due to them requiring rune shards to use their powers. Shyvana may possess such a shard assuming her mother had one and she has no older female siblings. Its possible that the fall of shurima is what causes many dragons (but not all) to disperse around runeterra.

Spirit realm dragons do not have a defined power source, and may use the dragon spirit's power as their own (makes sense that the best dragon spirit wielders are dragons themselves).

Celestial dragons get their power from Aurelion Sol since they are his creations. Though some exhibit elemental powers which will require future theorising to explain.

# How dragons work in runeterra

There are many types of dragon in runeterra. They can be found everyhwere, with many residing around demaica, noxus and ixtal and particularly large quantities around targon and ionia. Dragons are innately powerful beings, and its likely that this is due to magic. There are three main types of magic in  runeterra: elemental, celestial and spirit. Pretty much all draconic abilities can be classified like this, so it follows that they use magic to do things like use their breath weapons, and for some they may use it to fly or even to simply exist.

The majority of elemental dragons reside in Ixtal. It is likely that some of these dragons emigrated north to more temperate climates and ended up in demacia, noxus and ionia, possibly due to the fall of shurima (since many used to live in shurima too before its fall). Its important to note there obviously were almost certainly some dragons in ionia long before the fall of shurima. Firstborn females of some draconic bloodlines are born with an elemental rune shard within them, that gives them extraordinary elemental power. It is self explanatory then that all such drakes must draw power from such runes, and while they may not have a shard within them, the latent power of such shards gives them their elemental breaths. This brings us to a rather interesting conclusion. Dragons are **not** naturally elemental creatures. The typical fire breathing dragon only came about due to magical tampering somewhere in the dragon's history as a species. Shyvana for a half dragon appears to be fairly powerful, especially due to how she has the beginnings of respect from Aurelion Sol. Seeing as we have no info on any siblings she is the firstborn daughter of Yvva and may possess such a shard. Seeing as she is a champion it would make sense that in her draconic form she is more than just a common elemental dragon.

While Ionia has many elemental dragons, it also has many with ties to the spirit realm. Obviously there is the dragon spirit that lee sin wields the power of, but also within the possibly canon spirit blossom universe there are spirit dragons, and also the empyrean from LoR might have ties to the spirit realm given how different it is in nature to the elemental drakes. Given how ionia is where the spirit realm has the most contact with the material realm, it makes sense that dragons who draw on spirit magic originated in ionia. The only question now is why do these certain dragons get spirit powers while others don't, and why are these dragons different? Since the dragon spirit is the most powerful draconic spirit we know of, appearing to be one step below a spirit god, its possible that all such dragons may channel the power of the dragon spirit. But we don't exactly have tons of info.

And then there are dragons who wield celestial powers (I havn't called them celestial dragons since that is a specific type of dragon and not all of these are celestial dragons). While some don't appear to have much in the way of celestial power (whiteflame protector), they all originate from targon. It is fairly obvious where they get their power from, seeing as many of them have a directly attributed creator. Aurelion Sol. All dragons wielding celestial powers were either made by him or are descended from those made by him. The whiteflame protectors likely being some of the weakest due to having existed for aeons since their creation, or possibly they were just made weaker. What is interesting is that some dragons on targon exhibit elemental-eque powers like the whiteflame protector and the fused firebrand. This begs the question: why are Ixtali dragons appearing in targon when they already have their own draconic culture/ecosystem? Its possible that after the fall of shurima some that lived in shurima settled in targon and interbred with the targonian dragons. There is more to this idea, which I will discuss in later theories.

i started thinking of this after Varus’s LOR reveal and the reveal that his personality went through a whole shift only revealed by the flavor text on his card.

Last time we saw Varus he hated mortals as a whole with Kai and Valmar being whispers in his mind that Varus couldn’t tell apart.

To him reawakening his kindness and empowering mortals to fight against a Darkin? I can see it as a possibility but it really needed more buildup. they linked to all of Varus’s previous lore in his LOR reveal which means they expect us to read it. but then had no middle ground of Varus starting to change.

Which revealed a deeper issue with the lore. It has a set up and then maybe a payoff but with no middle part.

Because of the way the lore is produced. Some people I’m not sure who. dictates what champions get lore. 

It seems like they only want to give lore to characters when a new release rather it’s a new champion/card set/or event. Leading to characters being stuck in limbo unless their long loss dead sister can become a new sexy champion.



It also leads to prioritizing popular/“appealing” champions. See the Ruination event where Yorick and the other Shadow Island champions expect for Thresh being left to the sidelines and had Karma and Rengar get more lore devoted to them.

Of course some products like the Ruined King game or the Ruination book which follows Kalistia of all champions.;https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofleague/comments/y2601e/the_problem_with_how_league_of_legends_releases/;/r/loreofleague/comments/y2601e/the_problem_with_how_league_of_legends_releases/;self

Seeing as jungle is a good role to climb the ranks with I am looking to get a better understanding of jungle. 

I’ve probably played around 100 games jungle most of which were diana and kayn. I would like to keep diana in my pool, but I’m looking for some other champs to go with her. 

I’ve been playing sejuani recently and I’m really liking her, but I was wondering if tanks are included when people say “jungle is the best role to climb”. 

I’ve only played wukong a couple of times, but I’ve found that I do really well with him.  

This would give me a pool of Diana, Sej, and Wu. I figure these champs are easy enough mechanically to all have in my pool; however, I wouldn’t mind one tricking Sej. Would one tricking her be a good move or is she not as efficient at climbing as someone like wukong who can bring more damage rather than utility?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jungle_Mains/comments/y2jtar/is_sejuanitanks_good_for_climbing/;/r/Jungle_Mains/comments/y2jtar/is_sejuanitanks_good_for_climbing/;self

Than i have to gamble which lane will get camped when comming back from spawn by the enemy jungler.

For more information I was plat2 last season without any problems and now i'm struggling in gold. Even though i often manage to outsmart the enemy jg and become 1 or 2 lvls ahead with more objectives it is still a lose thanks to my (at best) 2/7 laners.

I'm applying for positions in research, data engineering/science, and software engineering. While I don't have a ton of experience in any of those, I think I have enough to warrant at least some responses or interviews.

t3_y2kdsp;t5_2qmsf;1665620996000;1665623730482;hair is broken and i need advice;i went in for a hair appointment yesterday. to preface, i have short brown hair, and asked for a blonde ashy money piece and an ombré. 
once they said they were finished, my hair colour looked exactly the same, maybe with a few strips of lighter brown here and there. once i got back to my place, i sent them an email basically regarding the fact that i didn’t feel like my hair sufficed the amount i payed ($316) considering i didn’t get what i asked for or didn’t see a change. 
this is where it gets bad. i’m quite young and naive and didn’t realise they may ask for me to go back to the store so they can check my hair. so i had bleach lying around, and decided to try and fix it. and it turned out horrible. i went to the store and bought a toner, however, the toner also did not change anything, but rather damaged my hair. it was after this that my partner brought up the fact that the salon may not refund me because there is no longer any evidence to suggest my hair was done incorrectly. i have photos of my hair and their treatments compared to the reference images i showed them, but do not know if that is enough evidence for a refund and am waiting to hear back from them. 
as for my general hair, my partner suggested to ask the salon to dye my hair back to its natural colour (brown) and let it grow out and restore its health with hair masks, deep conditioning treatments and oils. as for the very damaged bleach money piece, i am considering cutting face framing bangs to cut off the damaged ends before they can break higher to my roots where it is still salvageable. i was considering getting weft extensions to give the illusion of healthy hair, but only if i get a refund. if not, i will have to deal with looking like dora the explorer over the summer. 
i’ve been thinking about this a lot, especially as i do not feel confident when my hair is not good, and think that this would be the best course of action, i just feel so defeated as everything i have tried has failed whilst losing almost $400 because of it. does anyone have advice on what i should do?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/y2kdsp/hair_is_broken_and_i_need_advice/;/r/Hair/comments/y2kdsp/hair_is_broken_and_i_need_advice/;self

I’ve always liked being naked since I was very little, I used to go hide in my room and take my clothes off and just sit there but even then in my mind it was something sexual. I really just want to be able to see a human body without being immediately aroused, in my mind I know nudity is ok, nothing to be ashamed of and isn’t sexual in any way but after 18 years of being taught that it is it’s hard to break.

I know it’s physically possible and i figured if anybody would know how to start it would be nudists lol.

t3_y1a66j;t5_2qs47;1665497719000;1665623730717;Serendipity Park, Cleveland GA- First timers trip report;My wife and I just spent this past weekend at Serendipity Park in GA. We live in East TN where the closest places are a good three plus hours away. Based on everyone's recommendations here, we chose Serendipity for our first public experience.   TL;DR at the bottom for those who don't want to read it all.

We arrived on Friday evening, after the office had closed for the day, and were initially confused at what to do, but asked a gentleman who said they sometimes leave the keys taped to the office door for after hours arrivals. Sure enough, there was an envelope with our name and the key to the cabin inside, along with a park map. We were booked in cabin #3 and didn't expect too much, since we knew from the website that cabins 3 and 4 are what are called park model trailers (basically a short single-wide) and are just designed to look like a country cabin. However, we were quite impressed. Inside was very well maintained and quite clean; and it was a good size for two people. The couch was a pull out sleeper, so a small family could probably feel reasonably comfortable, if everyone in that family can share one small bathroom. 

After unloading the car, we stripped off and began to relax. We could hear people at the pool/clubhouse area having a good time and I suggested we go down and join them or at least go sit in the hot tub for a while. My wife wasn't quite ready to be around other people yet, so we stayed the evening in the cabin.

On Saturday morning, we got up around 8a and slowly got going - taking advantage of it being a vacation weekend for us with no schedule requirements. About 8:45a, we put on some sweats (the temps were in the low 50's) and went down to see about breakfast at the café. The café didn't open until 9a, so we sat down by the clubhouse and met a few other people who were up and drinking coffee in their PJ's and Onesie's. Once the café opened, we all went up and ordered breakfast. 

At this point, I'll note that we ate every meal that we could at the café. Joe (the only person I'll mention by name) was friendly and is a fantastic cook. The menu is pretty decent and is what I'd compare to a local diner - a little bit of everything - and just like a local diner, it's really good too. The food was better than chain restaurants, and WAY better than any fast food place. In fact, the fried chicken sandwich was one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The only downside is that the café is not open for every meal, every day.

After breakfast on Saturday, my wife and I went to the hot tub. There was no one in there at the time, so we stripped off, showered to rinse off, per the rules, and got right in. The hot tub is really nice. It's very large and we estimate could seat 16 people comfortably. (One of the staff/regulars later told us he thinks the official limit is 24 people.) After a few minutes in the hot tub, some other people came in to join us and we just sat and chatted for quite a while. Eventually the outside temps warmed into the 60's (on the way to a high of 74 that day) and it was a beautiful sunny day. Around late morning, people started showing up around the pool and laying out in the sun. Once we noticed that it was getting warm enough to do that, we left the hot tub and went out to do the same. We didn't bother getting dressed at that point and no one cared.

My wife later told me that when we were in the hot tub and she saw other people coming in was when she felt comfortable and the initial nervousness went away. Seeing other ladies around the hot tub and down by the pool helped her feel comfortable herself. She never had any fear or discomfort after that. In fact, she would often stay fully nude even when most of the other ladies would cover up to be warm, or put on their half sarongs to walk around.

We stayed out by the pool until the sun started going down behind the trees and it started to cool down again. While laying there, we had so many people come by and greet us and introduce themselves. It was so nice to be welcomed and treated like friends immediately. I got in the pool and played volleyball with some others a couple times. I even noticed that while I was in the pool, some of the other ladies would go by and talk to my wife so she was never alone or left out. That was very encouraging to see.

Around late morning, a small family came to the pool. The mom and dad brought their daughter who was, I'd guess about 8 or 9. We later found that this family lives at the park and all the residents have watched the little girl grow up. It was very encouraging, and comforting, to see everyone looking out for her. We heard from many of the regulars how they all watch out for the kids and often have a lot of kids there during the summer. My wife and I, being first timers and unsure about being around kids, were very pleased to see how well protected kids are and how natural and how much of a "non-issue" it really was to have kids around adults like that. Our kids are in their teens, but we may consider taking them with us next time.

That evening, after dinner, we spent some time in the clubhouse just talking to others, and enjoyed their wine and cheese party. Eventually we made our way back to the hot tub with some new friends and sat for a long time just chatting about each other's families and raising kids. We even exchanged numbers with them to keep in touch, and they even came back on Sunday afternoon where we all four hung out together for a while again. Shoutout to B and R for being so welcoming and friendly. Looking forward to seeing you both again in a couple months.

We had planned to go home on Sunday, only staying one full day so we could try it out and see what it was like. Again, being first timers, we were pretty nervous before we went and didn't know if we would like it, but wanted to at least try it to say that we had done it. Turns out, everyone was so nice and welcoming, and we had so much fun, that we decided to stay an extra day and come home on Monday. As it turns out, we liked it a lot. 

Sunday was a starkly different day though. It was pretty empty all day. We knew it wouldn’t be nearly as busy at the pool and clubhouse as Saturday, but assumed there would be at least a few people there. Other than seeing the occasional person in passing, it was pretty much just my wife and myself there all Sunday morning. As I noted above, B and R came back Sunday afternoon and I think we would have regretted our decision to stay if they had not come back. As it turns out, part of what made it so nice and comfortable to be there was all the people. We had thought being in the off-season would be better because we could adjust on our own time with fewer people around, but the reality is with very few people around, it felt more awkward. Having lots of people around made it so much more comfortable. Having more people around reduces the self awareness because you are just one of the group and don't stand out as much. 

Admittedly, it was a bit awkward on Friday night when we first arrived. We were nervous and unsure of ourselves. One of the first people I saw when we pulled up to the office was a larger fellow, standing at the rail next to the café overlooking the pool, wearing absolutely nothing. At that point it was like… "okay, wow. We're really here and we're really doing this." But like I wrote above, after a few minutes of being nude around other nude people on Saturday morning, it just became normal and comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, that my wife commented to some others on Saturday afternoon that she was looking forward to coming back… a lot. Though, my wife and I have talked and plan to adjust our "hairstyles" before returning, ha ha.

So, all that sounds great, but it wasn't all perfect and happy. There were two things that stuck out as negatives. First, was the bed in cabin 3. It squeaks and flexes, and the mattress has a bit of a sag in the middle. It was soft and comfortable enough, but every movement by either my wife or myself would shake the whole bed and wake up the other. Neither of us slept well at all the three nights we were there. 

The second issue happened pretty soon after moving down by the pool on Saturday morning. We were approached by a guy asking us if we'd been to the park next door and invited us to go with him over there to "play". I politely turned him down and said that was not what my wife and I were looking for, as I had previously read on here about the park next door being more swinger oriented and knew that is not what my wife and I wanted. After he walked away, I explained to my somewhat confused wife what he was asking. She was a little shocked once I explained what the park next door was. To make it worse, when I got in the pool a little while later to play volleyball, that same guy approached my wife when she was alone and offered her a blow pop. Now neither my wife or I know if there is any hidden meaning in the blow pop, but she, in her new knowledge of what he had previously asked, just set it down on the chair next to her and said thank you but that she'd like to be left alone. By the time I got out of the pool and she told me that he had approached her again, he was gone. I would not have been so polite the second time. After relaying that experience to some of the residents later that day, who seemed much more offended than we were, we were told that we should have let someone know the first time he approached us and he would have been escorted out of the park. Serendipity is a family friendly park and that kind of invitation is not tolerated at all. Since we were new, we didn't know the seriousness of that and just tried to politely let him go away. Next time, we'll make sure someone else knows if that happens.

In summary, we ended up having a great time and definitely plan to go back (and possibly to other places as well). While we were understandably nervous being first timers, all our fears and concerns were unfounded and we realized that we should have done this 20 years ago shortly after we got married and before we started having kids so we could have taken them with us and they could grow up with a healthier view of other humans as well. Everyone at Serendipity was very nice and welcoming and really made us feel like part of the group right away. We're already looking at our schedule for when we can go back and are even thinking about which of our friends would be most open to going with us and/or if we should take our teenage kids with us.

TL;DR - Went to Serendipity Park as first timers and had a great time. Everyone is super friendly, the food was great, and the cabin/trailer was well maintained and quite clean. Can't recommend this place highly enough to others.;https://www.reddit.com/r/nudism/comments/y1a66j/serendipity_park_cleveland_ga_first_timers_trip/;/r/nudism/comments/y1a66j/serendipity_park_cleveland_ga_first_timers_trip/;self

I've been getting into this game for a while now (still looking for potential players, though) and there's something I just can't wrap my head around: "Chemistry" and potential Chemist-type players.

I know that there are rules for street drugs and I personally like them, but the CRB and, as far as I know, other sourcebooks (Chrome, etc...) don't seem to give other infos on the subject.

To put it bluntly: where are the rules to make comounds, other than street drugs? Let's say Mr.White (a toooootally casual name for a PC!) wanted to make a specific kind of poison and biotoxin, or some new form of CHOO2, or a sleeping pill that could elude eventual Bioware immunities, etc...

How should I make him roll? What should the difficulty be? Is there some way to adapt the "side effects" thing from the streed drugs table? What kind of modifiers could be taken into account?

I'm so lost and I'm afraid I might not be able to balance things properly.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also read other people saying that poisons are very easy to make and therefore one should stick to the biotoxin damage table, but what about other things a Chemist could do? Even inventing new kinds of ammunition may be an idea, I don't know...The fact is I don't know how to figure the check out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text

t3_y2j8x4;t5_2tf29;1665617962000;1665623734666;13 in 13 - S7: The Day of the Doctor;***This is a part of a series of posts. You can find the rest of them*** [***here***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Crusader_2/comments/tc6kpc/13_in_13_masterlist/)***.***

“The Day of the Doctor” takes a very long time to get going. The first 30 minutes of the episode go by extremely slowly, and even after that the episode continues to be a bit of a drag for another 5-10 minutes.

This isn’t anyone’s fault. This slow-ness is necessary, and the episode’s 77 minute runtime is allowed to take time for exposition and buildup. However, I feel that this episode spends a bit *too* much time on the buildup, and very little time on the climax and resolution (which come in during the last 20 minutes of the story).

Part of this could be for the main reason that this story seems to be split into two separate stories: one smaller more direct story, and the other bigger story that embeds itself into the background. These two stories do meld together very nicely, but also make the story have to do double the exposition and rising action. Telling two stories at once and doing double the work.

The smaller story, the Zygon subplot, takes up most of the episode. Its premise is simple: a group of Zygons have been hiding from the Time War inside of Galifreyan art. In order to find a new home, they’ve decided to take over the Earth and make it their own planet.

This is something that could easily be in a normal episode of *Doctor Who*. One that you could find in the middle of your average series that would be seen as a more or less ‘average’ story featuring the return of the Zygons.

However, this is not the case. Three Doctors have been put up to the challenge of stopping this Zygon threat to humanity. In particular, three Doctors with a large connection with the Time War have been put to the task of stopping these shapeshifting aliens.

It’s here that the second part of this story comes into play. The thing that turns this story from an ‘average’ one into a 50th Anniversary special. The addition of David Tennant’s manic Tenth Doctor, and the brand new War Doctor played by the late-great Sir John Hurt. These two characters quickly change “The Day of the Doctor” from a story about the Zygons to a story about the Doctor and the Time War.

From the moment this story begins, we understand the situation that the War Doctor is put into. He’s about to commit the act that he will be reflecting upon since the moment that Nu-Who began. We know what he’s about to do, but we also learn that he’s still got a chance to change his mind. To attempt to this, the Moment decides to show him a glimpse of his future and see the man he becomes.

This allows the Zygon subplot to show the War Doctor how the future Doctors act. Putting them into a ‘normal’ story with *them* at the forefront allows War to see how his actions impact the man he becomes, bringing the Zygon subplot into the bigger narrative.

Suddenly, the War Doctor is on a journey to become ‘the Doctor’ again. As he’s faced with the task of blowing up Galifrey in order to create the life that his future incarnations will lead, a brand new idea pops into his (and the other Doctors’) heads. Trap Galifrey in a pocket universe and wipe the Daleks out. Just like that.

And after this we make it to this story’s *true* climax. All 13 incarnations of the Doctor come together to stop Galifrey from blowing up, and in one of the greatest moments of the show’s history the last 8 years of television history come to a proper close .

On paper this sounds brilliant, and it is. This episode pushes all the buttons it needs to, and will undoubtedly be compared against every single anniversary special that will come after it (including both the upcoming “The Power of the Doctor” and Russel T. Davies’ 60th stuff. The problem? The rest of the episode around it is not nearly as engaging.

As I’ve stated before, the writing aspect of this episode is phenomenal. You don’t need to come to me to see that, but I personally find this story a bit of a drag as a viewing experience. Its central moment is brilliant, but the other moments around it don’t really seem like the same caliber to me.

Still, it’s hard *not* to admit that this episode is good. There’s so much that’s done well with it, and you can tell that this episode (and the next one) is where Moffat put most of his effort for Series 7B. It’s very clear that Moffat did his best effort to not only make one hell of a penultimate story for the Eleventh Doctor, but to create one of the most memorable TV experiences out there in one 77 minute long special.

However, as sad as I am to admit it, our time with Mr. Bowtie himself is coming to an end. Much like his predecessors, he is about to face a battle that his face won’t come out of alive. As the eleventh hour draws to its close, it becomes increasingly clear that “The Time of the Doctor” is drawing near.

However, I'm quite unfamiliar with the characters or Jo or Nyssa, and I would like to know some Classic stories that expand upon their personalities/their history with the Master.;https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/y2c0vd/best_classic_stories_to_prepare_for_killing_time/;/r/gallifrey/comments/y2c0vd/best_classic_stories_to_prepare_for_killing_time/;
t3_y2bzmn;t5_2tf29;1665600486000;1665623734666;I don't actually mind it when the Doctor throws their name around;Perhaps the most common critique I see of parts of New Who as a whole is that people don't like it when the Doctor uses their own reputation to drive the monsters away. Certainly, the mid-to-late Moffat era did this too much, but I'd argue that, at its core, the concept is perfectly fine in Who, at least when used as a tool, and not an opener. 

The Doctors who do this the most are likely 7 (in expanded media especially), 10, and 11. By most counts, 7 himself is around a millennium old. Barring external factors, hundreds of years of driving the monsters away will have undoubtedly grown at least some sort of reputation, even considering the vastness of time. In 7's mind, if throwing his weight around gained him some extra time or fear into his enemies hearts, why wouldn't he do it? It's simply pragmatic. 

The most famous instances of 10 and 11 doing this are probably 10 in The Library and 11 before the assembled fleets in The Pandorica Opens. In both cases, these speeches of "I am the Doctor so go away" are explicitly to buy time; 11 even mentions this directly after he finishes. 

In summary, especially for the more vain/manipulative Doctors, mentioning their weight around every once in a while just makes sense. Of course, I would hate it if it happened every episode, or even if it was used to conclude an episode lazily, but on the whole I think it's fine.;https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/y2bzmn/i_dont_actually_mind_it_when_the_doctor_throws/;/r/gallifrey/comments/y2bzmn/i_dont_actually_mind_it_when_the_doctor_throws/;

*They're often surprising and interesting, so I thought I'd repost some general reactions to Thirteen's episodes here in the run up to her denouement, and get a sense of what her era meant to the general audience.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My son‘s review - “not a lot happened, but at least there wasn’t a lecture”.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My wife loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My 13 year old daughter said it wasn't bad but it dragged a bit and could have got further on quicker than it did.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They were interested in the Brendan storyline, disappointed in how ineffectual the Doctor was, and annoyed by the companions presuming to lecture the last seven survivors on not giving up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My friend watched with rapt attention throughout, and thought it was excellent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My Not We partner stayed awake throughout (result) and seemed to be confused by and intrigued by the scenes with Brendan, asking first 'when is this supposed to be taking place?' then 'Is that the same bloke?' when he was retiring from the police force, and then getting audibly upset when they put the ear phones on him and he started screaming. He really can't handle depictions of anything like 'torture', and dramatic depictions of child-birth usually get him hurrying out of the room (so not a big fan of 'Call the Midwife' lol). He continues to say he doesn't like Jodie, singling out her garbled delivery, difficult accent (!!!) and facial tics (such as the wrinkling nose thing). I have to say I disagree there. I think she is doing a great job as the Doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An interested but Not We friend who has been following this Season with increasing interest told me last night that he thought the depiction of the Cybermen in this episode was the best there has ever been. I asked what he thought about the flying Cyber heads and he said "that was a bit silly" but qualified that by saying it was good that all the Doctor's anti-Cybermen gadgets got blitzed before she even got a chance to switch them on. He was intrigued by the stuff leading up to the cliffhanger and was very pleased to see the Master pop up at the end. He has been much more into the show this year after being pretty meh about last season.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My wife said she loved it and thought it was possibly the best doctor Who she had seen.  
&gt;  
&gt;This differs from some other weeks when she hasn't caught up yet after dozing off!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For me, this was a whole load of meh. The boys though, aged seven and nine. Both absolutely loved this, and were on the edge of their seats all the way through.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My kids finally watched it last night on iplayer (I watched it alone on Sunday night - for the first time in years - they're still not keen on this series). They thought it was pretty average overall. They want to know more about the origins of the Lone cyberman and what he's doing to the other cybermen. They were also intrigued by the sequences with Brendan and were completely non-plussed with the retirement sequence when they realised his dad and the other guy hadn't aged at all. This led to some wild speculation and guessing -" Is he the lone cyberman, Master, Doctor etc etc?" I think they're a bit bored of the cybermen in general but at least this part of the story had them fully engaged. I just hope that the finale gives us some satisfactory answers..

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The hobbits all continue to love the series, and its the only time the whole family sit down and watch something together. Boy (6) remains terrified by a lot of the monsters and scary bits. Oldest girl remains adoring The Doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Responses are mostly positive with a big portion of "meh". The kids love it most of all, as usual. I can definitely imagine liking this one as a kid. The opening scene is quite tense and exciting.

The kids seem to like this era more than anyone, which is exactly what I wanted to hear. We'll probably see them online in 15 years, viciously complaining that the 19th Doctor isn't as good as Jodie Whittaker and wondering if they'll bring Graham back for RTD4.

t3_y1lmcz;t5_2tf29;1665525288000;1665623734666;The Doctor's character has always been more important to me than their origins, which is why the Timeless Child storyline itself and vehement backlash confuse me;Let me get it out of the way, ugh, it's another Timeless Child post, we can never escape, etc. But with *The Power of the Doctor* this month I thought I'd articulate some thoughts on what I think is important about the Doctor to me when I watch.

For context, I started by watching the new series and it took me several years to come acquainted with the classic series. My thoughts are likely colored by this introduction. To start, I am confused at the frequent notion that the Timeless Child or pre-Hartnell Doctors would 'ruin the whole show' for some people. 

What's always been important to me is the Doctor's character: they are a charismatic genius who always stands up for what is right, no matter the cost. The best example of this being the speech to the Masters in *The Doctor Falls*, which sums up the Doctor the best. "I do what I do because it's right, because it's decent, and above all, kind." To me this is far more important than whatever the latest backstory for the Doctor is. 

To be sure, I think Gallifrey is fun! Still, I think it's best usage is emphasizing that the Doctor came from a place of privilege, literally the most advanced society in the universe, and instead has decided to spend their time helping the 'common people'. The Doctor being an alien is a fun sci-fi thing, and Gallifrey is essentially space nobility that I see as helping to color in what makes the Doctor so impressive. I know that there are some people who are mad at pre-Hartnell Doctors because it muddies this exact thread, but modern Gallifrey wasn't even introduced until 15+ years of the show had ran. While it is annoyingly complicated now, nothing has changed about the Doctor eventually leaving Gallifrey of their own accord.

Alright, this brings me to my biggest Timeless Child gripe. Why do this storyline? Chibnall says it himself, in *The Timeless Children* and then again in *Flux* that all this new backstory about the Doctor doesn't matter, it's their character that matters. So why on Earth would you do this storyline in the first place? It just doesn't make sense to me, there's so much more to lose in alienating some people that don't think like I do and are a lot more invested in the Doctor's origins for the gain of...what? What about the Timeless Child has directly had an effect on the Doctor? If Chibnall is saying 'don't worry the Doctor is still the same person' then why do this storyline? This is also why I think the backlash is far overblown too, the Timeless Child changes nothing substantial about who the Doctor's character is. Nothing about how much I love a story like *Silence in the Library* is changed because of the Doctor was the Timeless Child. It's just not that relevant the way it has been presented. 

If the idea is to say the Doctor is actually the victim of a colonialist society that stole their power of regeneration and used it for themselves, I'm not actually that opposed to that idea. A lot of people are mad Gallifrey was killed off again (I don't care that much, I'm sure they'll be back when someone wants them back), but I think that storyline could've made a ton more sense if the Time Lord High Council was still around to answer for their actions instead of just the Master who has nothing to do with the Timeless Child story instead of accidentally finding it out. I think the storyline would've been much better if the Doctor discovers this and finally denounces Gallifrey once and for all and maybe even causes a schism much more severe than *Hell Bent*. 

This is a good segue into *Hell Bent*, which I think does everything *The Timeless Children* wants to do but far better. I know it's a very controversial story in its own right, but it has massive actual emotional stakes for the Doctor! Unlike in *The Timeless Children* where we get all this lore explanation but none of it matters to the Doctor's character, in *Hell Bent* we get a lot less lore than people wanted but the Doctor is absolutely completely a changed person afterwards. We're invested in stories not just for the awesome battles or the fun deep lore, but because of characters, and seeing them change and evolve. 

So basically, unless something changes in *The Power of the Doctor* (which does seem to be all about the power of regeneration, so, uh, cool I guess), the Timeless Child storyline is a confusing addition that doesn't do anything to actually change the Doctor's character, just put off the people who do care deeply about lore. I don't think it's actually that big a deal, and might have even been a big fan of it had it been executed correctly, but for now it's just a weird thing that exists that doesn't really change the show and has only introduced headaches.

Thanks for reading along, it's been two years and after reading tons of thoughts about the Timeless Child I was finally able to articulate my feelings ahead of *The Power of the Doctor*. At least this whole thing gave us Jo Martin's Doctor, who I adore.;https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/y1lmcz/the_doctors_character_has_always_been_more/;/r/gallifrey/comments/y1lmcz/the_doctors_character_has_always_been_more/;

t3_y2eb5t;t5_2tlj8;1665605950000;1665623734688;MZ3 2.5T issues;Long story short my car is in the hands of car innsurance going from dealership to dealership as no one can figure out what is happening to my car. The car was vandalized with a kick (not sure) by someone in October 2021, made a claim, no major issues just a small dent by the passenger headlight, took it to get inspected they said it would need a new fender or at least repaired. No biggie, no rush, not major, and didn't feel like dropping $1k on the deductible for a dent so I figured I'd wait a year n get it done (financial reasons). Fast forward to September 2022 the car is on the fritz.

Keyfob will not open the doors, used physical key to gain entry, turn the car on and it's running weird, windshield wipers full blast, sun screen will not move, AC shows set at 68F but is not running, infotainment system is the only thing that is working correctly, entire dash is lit up with every single warning light, car won't leave park, have to pop the emergency latch to shift into drive, lights are running but hazard lights and blinkers will not engage when turned on. Right side passenger headlight is completely out, and condisation in inside it.

I assumed it had something to do with the vandalism, called innsurance company and the car has been in their hands ever sense. 2 Mazda dealerships, and one Mazda specific body shop can not figure it out. They are even calling in master techs to from different locations to come look at it. One dealership suggested to change the entire wire harness, but me and the innsurance company both agree that there is no way for sure to know if that will fix the issue for the long term. We are trying to figure out if this is an innsurance issue only, or both innsurance and warranty.

Car has gotten worse, battery is being completely drained, will not start now unless jumped, and test batteries were put in and drained them as well. At least before it held a charge, now not so much.

So what do you guys think? Hairline Crack behind the headlight that caused water to get into the assembly and the water crept its way down the wires cuasing havoc to the harness and shorting something out? Body control moduel maybe going out randomly?

Only modifications done to the car is removing the mufflers, and resonator, car was running for months like that fine, should not be causing this electrical issue, but thought I'd mention it incase some were curious about any mods I may of had. Otherwise car is bone stock.

Thoughts?

(Also called my friends who own a performance shop, helped me do my RX7 FC K24 swap, they think from the sounds of it, also without looking at it, sounds electrical and possibly the harness).;https://www.reddit.com/r/mazda3/comments/y2eb5t/mz3_25t_issues/;/r/mazda3/comments/y2eb5t/mz3_25t_issues/;self

t3_y2f66v;t5_3l98x;1665607971000;1665623734703;Dungeon Hunter Champions is a game that existed…;A 3D monster collector that came out a few years ago. Followed the typical format with one or two extra modes but not much else.

They gave away free light / dark five stars to twitch streamers for promotional purposes and this caused controversy. 

I didn’t really mind this and spent about $150 on summoning and just trying to have fun.

About a year after release the game was dying drastically. It stopped receiving updates so now it just sits in the App Store collecting cash from unsuspecting players. 

There are glitches like an exploit that adds additional people to a guild past the limit. 

Events are recycled over and over. 

I’m not playing anymore obviously but this is an example of a game that had potential and completely dropped the ball, stopped updating and abandoned its player base.

t3_y27twk;t5_3l98x;1665590660000;1665623734703;Counterside‘s Gameplay Isn't Bad;I think it's become a common notion for player's that have given Counterside the good ol' college try that the gameplay itself is the reason they cannot enjoy the game. "There's too much shit on the screen", "I don't understand what my units are doing in relation to the enemies, it's too chaotic", "Why don't I have more control over my units", are all valid concerns, so let's address them one by one.

1. A lot of the visual bells and whistles can be toggled off in the options menu. This makes it so that you can look at the screen without getting a seizure. Also, taking all this stuff out of the equation makes it much easier to see what's happening.
2. There's still going to be a lot going on even once you adjust your options. Just make sure you read up on your unit's skills so you can get a good idea of what they do on the battlefield. Eventually, you'll come across stages where you'll need to exercise a bit of brainwork and manually deploy your units. Set your speed to x1 so that you don't get overwhelmed.
3. Counterside is an autobattler at its core. The only factors you have autonomy over are deployment (the timing and order of placing a unit are very important), ship skills (can turn the tide of battle very easily when used at the right moment) and unit special skills (which can usually be left on auto outside of PvP scenarios). Placement, placement order and timing are the bread-and-butter elements within the actual gameplay, after that you can just watch your units do their thing.

At the end of the day if you've already played Counterside and decided that it isn't your cup of tea then who am I to tell you otherwise? The game still has its fair share of non-ideal stuff like the excessive amount of menu navigating (still a massive improvement since I come from GBF), gear sorting that leaves a lot to be desired and of course gear RNG (what'd you expect from a KR game). Still, Counterside is a gem in the rough and deserves more love, especially from artists. Come on, we're experiencing an unprecedented fan art drought and the global subreddit is drier than the Saharan Desert.;https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/y27twk/countersides_gameplay_isnt_bad/;/r/gachagaming/comments/y27twk/countersides_gameplay_isnt_bad/;self

Take note these are just a summary so if you have more detailed or added information please add a comment. Also if your games have events happening right now please do share.


Last Cloudia - 3.5 year anniversary will start tomorrow with lots of freebies including a free UR ark selector ticket, 250 free pulls, 50 stock pulls that that also includes some DoH units, and many more gifts. 


War of the Visions - 2.5 anniversary is still going on. With Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Tactics collab happening at the same time. There's also lots of gifts and free pulls. 


Octopath Traveler CotC - Bravely Default collab happening atm. The next two collab banner units will have a free 10 pull in a way of apology for the fucked up they've done in the first banner. 


Counterside - free

160 pulls until next week. Good time to reroll. You can do 16 multi pulls on the get go after making an account. Though I suggest to reroll first for an awakened unit before doing all the pulls.


Alchemy Stars - Halloween event next week. 


Dislyte - there's a current event where you can get a free 4* shimmer esper. I came back because of this but will uninstall again later because I got reminded why I quit in the first place. 


Epic 7 - not really an event but more of a PSA. In a couple of weeks there's going to be a nerfed for the unit Hwayoung so you can trade the unit for another unit of your choice. So basically if you have two copies, you can trade a copy and keep the second one. 


Eroica and Artery Gear - I'm still waiting for an event.;https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/y1zw75/psa_events_anniversary_collaboration_happening_at/;/r/gachagaming/comments/y1zw75/psa_events_anniversary_collaboration_happening_at/;self

t3_y29dmt;t5_2s45l;1665594225000;1665623735194;Jeopardy! recap for Wed., Oct. 12;Let's meet today's contestants:

- Fernando, a graduate student, is a tutor with the Rise program;
- Elizabeth, a student, made "stay-at-home uncle" go viral; and
- Cris, a customer success operations manager, was unfairly denied points at Pictionary. Cris is an eight-day champ with winnings of $275,502.

Jeopardy! 

THE 17th CENTURY // HAIR // THEY MAKE THAT // WAIST UP, NECK DOWN // WORDS THAT SHOULD RHYME // IDINA MENZEL ACTS &amp; SINGS

DD1 - $800 - THE 17th CENTURY - In 1642 this explorer made landfall at the Australian island now named for him (On the first clue of the game, Cris won the table limit of $1,000.)

Scores going into DJ: Cris $6,000, Elizabeth $1,000, Fernando -$200.

Double Jeopardy! 

BIRTH OF AN ARTIST // MOVIE STUFF // STEP UP TO THE PLATE // QUICK! NOVELS! // 6-SYLLABLE WORDS // "GO"ING PLACES

DD2 - $1,600 - BIRTH OF AN ARTIST - She was born in what's now part of Pittsburgh in 1844, but Paris would eventually be home (Cris added $2,800 to his total of $11,600 vs. $1,800 for Elizabeth.)

DD3 - $1,600 -  STEP UP TO THE PLATE - The first fossils belonging to this dinosaur with bony plates in its back were discovered in the 1870s (Cris added $4,000 to his score of $15,600 vs. $5,000 for Elizabeth.)

Cris was comfortably in control the entire way, sweeping the DDs while making modest wagers and cruising into FJ at $29,600 vs. $8,600 for Elizabeth and $5,000 for Fernando.

Final Jeopardy!

20th CENTURY LEADERS - In a Sept. 3, 1939, speech, he said, “Everything that I have worked for…has crashed into ruins”

Everyone was correct on FJ. Cris added $8,221 to win with $37,821 for a nine-day total of $313,323.

Odds and Ends

Triple Stumpers of the day: Cris recalled too late that hairstyle that comes from the French for "to puff" is bouffant, and no one guessed the candy maker that bought out Peter Paul is Hershey.

Clue selection strategy: Cris determined the most likely location for the first round DD, in the fourth row of a history category, and found it immediately. He is demonstrating time and time again that successful DD hunting is not a matter of pure luck, but of understanding data and game logic.

Pavlov time: As it relates to art, mobile = Calder.

Correct Qs: DD1 - Who was Tasman? DD2 - Who was Cassatt?  DD3 - What is stegosaurus? FJ - Who was Chamberlain?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/y29dmt/jeopardy_recap_for_wed_oct_12/;/r/Jeopardy/comments/y29dmt/jeopardy_recap_for_wed_oct_12/;spoiler

t3_y24lwl;t5_2s45l;1665582883000;1665623735194;Coryat Poll for Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022;How did you do today? What was your Coryat score? This is also a place to chat and exchange notes about how you performed, how this compares to your average, any trends you’re noticing, the trickiness and difficulty of the boards, categories and clues, etc. For the main discussion of today’s game, please see the recap thread. Thank you!

If you’re new to Coryat scores, here’s how you can track and get your score for a game:

Keep score of how you do on every question in the day‘s game.

After playing, add the point value for all clues for which you would ring in, if you were on the show, and answer correctly before you hear one of the contestants give the correct answer, and then:

Subtract for the clues you would ring in on and not respond correctly in a timely fashion, before hearing one of the contestants give the correct response, with no plus or minus if you would not ring in.

Note about “bounce backs“: if a contestant misses on a question, and you respond with the correct answer after that and before another contestant gives the correct response, you can count it, but only if you did not “ring in“ and respond incorrectly first. In the latter case, you deduct as a miss.

For daily doubles, you add the face value if you are correct but do not deduct if you are incorrect.

You can learn more from Karl Coryat about his score tracking method at his webpage: [http://www.pisspoor.com/jep.html](http://www.pisspoor.com/jep.html)

I was quickscoping people .. it was the most fun I have ever had in 2 decades of gaming... But.... I wasn't productive enough. I was spending WAY too much time in VR. 

Flash forward 1 year .. I trade the markets religiously and work remote as a data analyst using Microsoft 365 (Excel, Teams, and Power Bi). 

What gets me hype is...

-The idea of putting on a lightweight headset and having 5+ virtual monitors is VERY appealing (traveling with my trading setup). 
- Being able to watch videos from YouTube and take virtual notes
- Answering Team calls from my VR workroom.
- Messing with AR, web 3.0 stuff

And above all. I GET TO QUICKSCOPE MF again. 😤. And see all the VR homies I abandoned 🥺

Someone please explain to me that the quest pro has the graphics and battery life of a potato, it weighs 50lbs, nobody is going to remotely collaborate with me, day trading doesn't even work in VR like I think it does, and you'd have to have literally negative brain cells to pay 1500 for a headset it's going to be massively outclassed in the next year or two.

t3_xzcit3;t5_3ad8o;1665289912000;1665623735199;Streaming on AMD GPUs?;So, I'm currently in the beginning phases of considering a GPU upgrade for my GTX 1060 6 GB. GPU prices are dropping, and I'm finally seeing a reasonable jump in performance for not terrible prices. At least...if you're willing to consider AMD. The 3060 is ridiculously expensive at its current $379 price tag and the 3050 is barely an upgrade at all as far as I'm concerned.

BUT...if I go AMD, I can get a rx 6600 for $250, or a 6600 xt or 6650 xt for something just north of $300. 

Things were looking good for AMD....until I came across the streaming encoding problem. 

While for a good 9 months of the year, I regularly use my PC, for the summer months, due to how my house is set up, I'm running an ethernet wire across the house to the few rooms which actually have air conditioning, and playing games in my room using my steam link. 

And nvidia....has hardware encoding. Good hardware encoding. I actually remembered the early days of steam in home streaming where I'd try to stream to my now ancient laptop, and it was terrible. Back then streaming used my CPU and any game that was CPU demanding (on an already CPU bottlenecked system) was unplayable. And I quickly gave up on streaming. But using NVENC encoding with my current system, I can stream to my steam link with almost no performance cost, meaning I get 1080p/60 FPS gaming that's stable and has almost no problems. 

And now I'm considering switching to team red for a GPU upgrade because it's almost a whole third cheaper for 90% of the performance. 

So...how bad is AMD encoding? For reference, I play a lot of shooters, and I set the stream quality to fast in order to cut down on input lag, but from what I heard, AMD hardware encoding is terrible and has awful image quality. I'm not unwilling to make SOME sacrifices in image quality for faster responsiveness in games, but beyond a certain point, I just cant really play the games. if I cant see what im shooting at, how can I play a shooter on the link? And if i turn up stream quality too much, well, then i cant aim at people fast enough anyway, making games virtually unplayable in another way. 

For reference, I did try to look at videos people made comparing stream quality. In some cases I couldnt tell the difference, but at other times, yeah the AMD looked a lot blockier and it could obscure enemies. 

That said, I have to ask, is it worth considering an AMD card if using steam link is a major factor in my purchasing decision? Does anyone use modern AMD cards like say the RX 6000 series (specifically the 6600 cards) to stream games to their steam link? Is it fun? is it playable? Is the performance significantly worse than nvidia? Can you see what you're doing decently enough while keeping performance costs and input lag to a minimum?

And in case anyone is wondering why i dont just use CPU streaming...uh...im using a 7700k from 2017. That's why. Modern games tend to heavily use my CPU and with the upgrade to the 6600, I expect CPU bottlenecks in quite a few games. I still expect 60ish FPS...but if CPU bottlenecks in streaming are still as bad as they used to be, i expect to have a bad time if I use CPU overhead I dont have to stream to my steam link. I'd rather keep my framerate high and use GPU hardware encoding if possible. I may upgrade the CPU eventually, but that's an entire platform upgrade, and I won't be doing it this year. I might not even do it next year. When will I do it? When I can get an affordable deal to something much better than what I have. 

So yeah. Is it worth using a rx 6600 or similar AMD card with steam link? What are your experiences with it, especially for those of you who have used nvidia cards in the past too?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam_Link/comments/xzcit3/streaming_on_amd_gpus/;/r/Steam_Link/comments/xzcit3/streaming_on_amd_gpus/;self

I'm running Steamlink on a Pi4 with OSMC, functionality-wise it works fine.

But when I start Steamlink I get a message saying  "You are running with less than 128 MB video memory, you may need to go to the Raspberry Pi Configuration and increase your GPU memory."

Which I have to press enter on to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

As my goal is to not use any keyboard/mouse to control the Pi, it's a bit of a pain to plug in a keyboard just to press ENTER.

Is there any way to disable the video memory popup or somehow translate controller input as a keyboard click?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

I solved it by just editing the [steamlink.sh](https://steamlink.sh) in \~/.local/share/SteamLink

I just replaced 

    show_message --warning $"You are running with less than 128 MB video memory, you may need to go to the Raspberry Pi Configuration and increase your GPU memory."

t3_y2jmat;t5_2qiht;1665618954000;1665623735627;Jdete programovat se mnou?;Nedávno jsem si updatoval CV a s hrůzou jsem zjistil, že se už přes 10 let živím vývojem softwaru. Prošel jsem si několika firmama, zažil spoustu legrace, stresu a jeden solidní burnout, kterej mě na půl roku dostal na neschopenku. Nyní jsem ve fázi, kdy se smiřuju s tím, že nevytvořím novej programovací jazyk, plně neovládnu ASM a asi ani nebudu jeden ze speakerů na konferencích. Přesto vnitřně cítím, že vyměňovat bajty za proplacený faktury pro toho, kdo mě zrovna platí, je pro naplněnej život trochu málo.

Rozhodl jsem se proto, že se pustím do projektu, o jehož fundamentech přemýšlím už pár let, ale vždycky jsem si říkal, že ještě nenastal čas. To ale není pravda, ten čas nastal ve chvíli, kdy mě to poprvé napadlo ... od té doby čas už jenom ztrácím :)

O co tedy jde? Chybí nám centrální doménová kategorizace všeho. Jestli jsi z IT, tak asi znáš pojmy jako docker, namespace, kubernet, scrum. Všechny tyto pojmy  jsou výsledek snahy o standardizaci a unifikaci toolů nebo procesů. Ale zároveň jde o věci, které jsou strašně spjaté se samotným vývojem softwaru. Dnes se nám ale IT rozlezlo i do zcela neočekávaných sfér a já věřím, že je potřeba standardizovat znalostní kategorie. Představte si webovou stránku (něco jako wiki) kde si můžete vybrat oblast vašeho zájmu v nějaký stromový struktuře. Takže jestli jsi anorganickej chemik, tak tě bude zajímat chemistry.inorganic (od obecnýho ke konkrétnímu) jestli biolog, tak biology a jestli odborník na Jana Nerudu, tak literature.czech.majovci.neruda

OK, takže máme nějak uspořádanou znalostní hierarchii - co s tím? To už je jenom na nás. Můžeme si vymyslet jakoukoli "znalostní" abstrakci a tu promítnout do těchto kategorií. Jako příklad uvedu třeba otestování znalostí pro danou doménu, definice modelů (JSON schema nebo openAPI specifikace), timeliny .... a tak dále a tak dále.

Super, ještě čteš, takže co teď? V první řadě potřebuju jakýkoli feedback a diskuzi, pomocí které se nějak odrazím k tomu co dál. Celá iniciativa je zamýšlená jako opensource. Navíc bych rád inkrementy průbežně prezentoval a umožnil vám se buď něco z programátorskýho řemesla přiučit nebo mi to úplně zhajtovat :)

t3_y1nbfa;t5_34n2x;1665529649000;1665623735633;Fleeting Fate of the Jumi - stages to farm;We now have all the stages available for the VW event [Fleeting Fate of the Jumi](https://lapis-prod-staticnews-gumi-sg.akamaized.net/prod//en/img/20221004xpgTheFleetingFateOfTheJumi.png) and as with the previous VW events, it's best to farm the stages that give the random drops until you have enough materials to craft 2 or 3 of the 6 equipment / materia, and then farm the specific stages that drop the specific materials to craft the remaining.

Or, after you've farmed the random material drops, you can also check if you have enough Memory Fragments to craft the remaining specific materials you need (but don't forget the Memory Fragments are also used as the exchange currency with King Mog).

For what stages to farm, we have 2 "final bosses" that both fights cost 50 NRG and both drop 30x Memory Fragments and 30x random material - the Lord of Jewels 999 and Lord of Jewels 1000. It looks to be better to farm LoJ 999 as the "easier" boss to farm since it gives the same rewards for the same NRG.

For the fights with the specific materials to farm, we have Lvl 1, Lvl 2, and Lvl EX. It's best to farm the **Lvl 2** boss that drops 10x Memory Fragment and 10x the specific material as this fight costs 20 NRG, instead of the EX fight that drops 10x Memory Fragment and 20x the specific material for 40 NRG - since my comment above you can also use the Memory Fragment to craft that materials you need.

I haven't had time to figure out my farm team yet, but if anyone has a quick clear team, please share.

Here's the materials that drop with each fight and what they are used to craft:

&amp;#x200B;

|Boss|Material|Equipment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Du'Inke|Pearl|Pearl Pendant|
|Bud &amp; Lisa|Aura Gold|Broom|
|Mantis Ant|Greenball Bun|Salesman Glove|
|Jewel Beast|Emerald|Emerald Ring|
|Iron Centaur|Lapis Lazuli|Blackened Mail|
|Machine Golem|Logic Block|Logic Grid (materia)|

t3_y2e44t;t5_2qh53;1665605495000;1665623735636;Are there any busts and sculptures found from the Byzantine empire that are post Arab invasion?;I know that statues were still being made and modified during the Byzantine empire. For instance, a statue of Empress Irene comes to mind. That one was placed along the Spina of the Hippodrome.

There’s a famous “roundel” that depicts John 2 Komnenos in the Dumbarton Oaks museum. For me this comes close towards a more sculptured depiction of a byzantine emperor. Of course there’s also the amazing ivory works during the Macedonian era, which really shows the skill of artists in this era. 

Roundel:

Macedonian era Veroli casket:

https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O70463/veroli-casket-casket-unknown/

These two examples are only relief art, and are not classical statues like they were being made in the pagan era of the empire. The casket also is made of ivory and is of course quite small. 

Even though a lot of statues are reportedly reused to depict a different emperor, new statues were being made throughout the byzantine era. However I can’t find any physical evidences.

It seems to me that any statues and busts post Phocas/Heraclius seem to be entirely lost. Even Justinian era statues and busts are rare…;https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y2e44t/are_there_any_busts_and_sculptures_found_from_the/;/r/history/comments/y2e44t/are_there_any_busts_and_sculptures_found_from_the/;
t3_y20ubi;t5_2qh53;1665572412000;1665623735636;Bookclub Wednesday!; Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist));https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y20ubi/bookclub_wednesday/;/r/history/comments/y20ubi/bookclub_wednesday/;

t3_y1fez3;t5_2qh53;1665510412000;1665623735636;Roman siege warfare and the impact on economic/social inequality?;Hi. Recently I came across Scheidels 'great-leveling' these, stating that mass-mobilization warfare, state failure, transformative revolution and plagues are four phenomena that level economic inequality between rich and poor. As siege warfare is quite often a form of mass mobilization warfare and total war, one would expect that in some cases economic inequality between rich and poor would level.Scheidel gives some examples of how sieges may contribute to leveling social inequality, but does not extend too much on the topic. 

Do any of you know some examples of sieges where Scheidels phenomena could be applied to (even if it is in a very minor form)? Or do you rather think that the these does not really apply to roman siege warfare? I have strong believes that it does, but could not find any convincing examples...

t3_y0ukit;t5_2qh53;1665447777000;1665623735636;American Serial Killers and the Vietnam War: A Table of Draft Dodgers and Military Service;In the 1960s, anti-war movements increased across the U.S. until even veterans joined in protests by the end of the decade. In 1969, the draft lottery was used for the first time since World War II and applied to all eligible men born between 1944-1950. Draft avoidance and evasion was increasingly socially acceptable during the Vietnam War, and was especially prevalent among young people at college campuses (The Guardian). Many men during this time dodged the draft by marrying, enrolling in school for a semester, or by faking disqualifying traits such as insomnia, drug-use or homosexuality (SSS.gov, UMich).

Several famous serial killers opted to voluntarily enlist in "safer" branches of the military such as the Air Force or Navy to avoid drafts that would send them to fight in direct combat overseas. I have created a table examining American serial killers during the 1960s/1970s Vietnam War draft lotteries including prior military experience.

The N69 to N72 are draft lottery tables:

* N69: 29 serial killers, 14 in draft lottery
* N70: 2 serial killers, 0 in draft lottery
* N71: 3 serial killers, 0 in draft lottery
* N72: 4 serial killers, 2 in draft lottery (Never Called)

**Discussion Points/Quick Info:**

* How many potential serial murderers do you think were killed in Vietnam?
* “Son of Sam” and “The Genesee River Killer” were among the only killers happy to serve.
* 42% of serial killers had birthdays assigned to drafted lottery numbers. (16/38)
* 38% of serial killers who would have been called in the draft lottery were exempt due to their prior military service. (6/16)
* 29% were incarcerated / transients at the time of the lottery. (11/38)

Relevant Disqualifying Classifications (Return to the Draft):

* **2-S** – Registrant deferred because of activity in study. \[Going to college/university.\]
* **4-A** – Registrant who has completed service; or sole surviving son.
* **4-F** – Registrant not qualified for military service. \[Failed physical examination.\]

The last draft call was in December 1972. The Administrative Processing Number (APN) denotes the highest lottery number called each year. Those born in 1953 were never called for service as the authority to induct expired on June 30, 1973.

The highest lottery number called for each group is the APN. All men assigned that lottery number or any lower number, and who were classified as available for military service, were called to report for possible induction. (SSS: Vietnam Lotteries)

|**Table**|**Date of Drawing**|**Applied to Year of Birth**|**APN**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1970|December 1, 1969|1944-1950|195|

# Side Note on Ted Bundy

[Ted Bundy’s military status was 4-F](https://www.reddit.com/r/TedBundy/comments/y1aksk/ted_bundys_military_status_was_4f_deemed_unfit/), meaning he was deemed “unfit for military service” and disqualified based on physical, mental, or moral grounds following a physical examination. This could have been for a wide number of reasons, ranging from faking drug addiction to simply paying someone off.

&gt;For the young Americans who are being called up to fight in Vietnam this is one of the most unpopular wars in American history. At least it appears to evoke no sort of enthusiasm. While attempts to escape the call-up or draft have been made on a small scale in all wars the extent and deviousness of the present draft-dodging is unparalleled and it is today socially acceptable as it never was in the past. ...  
&gt;  
&gt;A small number of young men attempt to deceive their draft medical board into grading them unfit for service. Some represent themselves as homosexuals - "Wear lace panties and worry no more" - "News Week"; or drug addicts - by pricking their arms to simulate hypodermic injections; or tuberculosis sufferers - drops of ink on cigarettes are said to produce temporary patches on the lung.

**Source 4:** [**Draft Lottery (1969)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_lottery_(1969)#Method)

&gt;In the 1960s, anti-war movements started to occur in the U.S., mainly among students on college campuses and in more leftist circles. By the end of the decade, the anti-war movement included many veterans who had served in Vietnam as well as a lot of middle-class parents with draft-age sons. College students were entitled to a deferment (2-S status) but were subject to the draft if they dropped out, stopped making "normal progress" in community college (i.e., started a fifth semester before transferring to a four-year college) or graduated.

**Source 5:** [**SSS: Changes from Vietnam to Now**](https://www.sss.gov/history-and-records/changes-from-vietnam-to-now/)

&gt;Before Congress reformed the draft in 1971, a man could qualify for a student deferment if he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study. He could continue to go to school and be deferred from service until he was too old to be drafted.

**Source 6:** [**SSS: Vietnam Lotteries**](https://www.sss.gov/history-and-records/vietnam-lotteries/)

&gt;The last draft call was on December 7, 1972, and the authority to induct expired on June 30, 1973. The date of the last drawing for the lottery was on March 12, 1975. Registration with the Selective Service System was suspended on April 1, 1975, and registrant processing was suspended on January 27, 1976.

**Source 7:** [**UMich: The Military Draft During the Vietnam War**](https://michiganintheworld.history.lsa.umich.edu/antivietnamwar/exhibits/show/exhibit/draft_protests/the-military-draft-during-the-)

&gt;On December 1, 1969, the first draft lottery since 1942 began, but college deferments were kept intact. ... The military draft brought the war to the American home front. During the Vietnam War era, between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. military drafted 2.2 million American men out of an eligible pool of 27 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;While many soldiers did support the war, at least initially, to others the draft seemed like a death sentence: being sent to a war and fight for a cause that they did not believe in. Some sought refuge in college or parental deferments; others intentionally failed aptitude tests or otherwise evaded; thousands fled to Canada; the politically connected sought refuge in the National Guard; and a growing number engaged in direct resistance.

**Source 8:** [**Selective Service System 1948 to 1969**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_System#1948_to_1969)

&gt;President John F. Kennedy set up Executive Order 11119 (signed on 10 September 1963), granting an exemption from conscription for married men between the ages of 19 and 26. His vice president and later successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, later rescinded the exemption for married men without children by Executive Order 11241 (signed on 26 August 1965 and going into effect on midnight of that date). However, married men with children or other dependents and men married before the executive order went into effect were still exempt.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Military Selective Service Act of 1967 expanded the ages of conscription to the ages of 18 to 55. It still granted student deferments, but ended them upon either the student's completion of a four-year degree or his 24th birthday, whichever came first.;https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y0ukit/american_serial_killers_and_the_vietnam_war_a/;/r/history/comments/y0ukit/american_serial_killers_and_the_vietnam_war_a/;

t3_y0nrhy;t5_2qh53;1665430394000;1665623735636;Historical factors in the 1950s and 60s that made the Cuban revolution and its leaders(Castro and Che) popular in the developing world that I think should be appreciated more.;The Cuban revolution was a significant event in the 20th century and one that propelled its leaders, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, to become iconic political figures in the 20th century. Their reception varied depending on the context they were viewed in. In an American context they were viewed negatively due to the association with communism and authoritarianism. In the developing world though at the time, it was widely different. They were admired as revolutionary leaders and these are historical factors. These factors will include both the context as well as historical precursors that could have shaped global perceptions in the developing world of the Cuban revolution in the 1950s and 60s.

**(i)Post War decolonisation and Che Guevara's internationalism**

* When the Cuban revolution started out Castro and many of his compatriots were nationalists. They were focused on specific issues in Cuba and they drew inspiration from historical Cuban nationalist figures such as Jose Marti and Carlos Manuel Cespedes. Now even with this specifically nationalist focus the revolution was famous enough.
* Che Guevara's presence in the ranks of the Cuban revolutionaries was important in terms of bring an internationalist perspective. Which isn't that surprising. The Argentine who on his motorcycle travelled all of Latin American, landed in Guatemala when the CIA coup was taking place, and then landed in Mexico to meet Castro. Che brought an ideological internationalism to a revolution that had a nationalist start. And you could see this in the roles that he played. He was one of the founding fathers of Cuba's Medical Internationalism. He was a key diplomat who was important in forging the revolutionary government's diplomatic ties both with the Eastern Bloc as well as many of the Non Aligned countries of the third world as well as revolutionary movements.
* Che's internationalism happen to take place at the same time that you had post war decolonisation movements. The Egyptian revolution of the 50s under Nasser. The Algerian revolution of the 50s and 60s with Ahmed Ben Bella. The independence movement of the Congo, etc. Che's internationalism formed if you will a bridge between the Cuban revolution and the anti colonial movements at the time. And this is symbolised in Che's speech in Algeria in 1965.

**(ii)The Bay of Pigs and the context of CIA coups in the developing world**

* Another reason for the Cuban revolution's popularity in the developing world was the victory at the Bay of Pigs. The historical context for this being significant are the CIA coups of the 50s and 60s. When you place the coups in Iran(53) Guatemala(54) Congo(60) and other attempted coups such as Indonesia in the background of the Bay of Pigs it becomes obvious why many in the developing world at the time would view this as an inspiration because it ended up symbolising a type of defiant self determination. 

**(iii)The Cuban revolution and the background of Latin American independence leaders**

* I had hinted at before the role of Cuba's independence leaders like Cespedes and Jose Marti in terms of inspiring the nationalist element of the Cuban revolution. I also think that the memory of Latin America's independence was what inspired its popularity throughout Latin America. Figures such as Simon Bolivar and Jose San Martin's story of fighting an anti colonial war of independence throughout Latin America would have had some similarities with the story of Castro and Che in the minds of some Latin Americans. Especially Che Guevara's story of the Argentine who journey's North, mirroring Jose San Martin in his meeting with Simon Bolivar. 

**(iv)The Cuban Revolution and the Anti Apartheid Movement**

* The Cuban revolution had a major inspiration on the Anti Apartheid movement of the 20th century. In the 1960s when the ANC was forming its military wing they took as an inspiration for their military doctrines Che Guevara's manual on Guerilla War. When Nelson Mandela made his "I am prepared to Die" speech he states explicitly it was partly inspired by Castro's "History will Absolve Me" speech. And then there was the military assistance Cuba gave during the Cold War. This of course amplified the Cuban revolution's popularity in Africa. 

You combine this with both the military and medical internationalism of the Cuban government during the Cold War and it explains its popularity.;https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y0nrhy/historical_factors_in_the_1950s_and_60s_that_made/;/r/history/comments/y0nrhy/historical_factors_in_the_1950s_and_60s_that_made/;

t3_y28ftt;t5_2s6e6;1665592052000;1665623735896;Oxidation states of phosphorus and boron;Hi everyone,

I am having a problem with assigning oxidation states to phosphorus and boron in PPh3BH3 molecule (image below). 

I know that phosphorus in PPh3 is in +3 oxidation state, and boron in BH3 is in +3 oxidation state as well. However, in PPh3BH3, phosphorus forms a dative bond with empty p orbital of boron atom and that's when my confusion starts to form. 

I don't understand what are the oxidation states of phosphorus and boron in this complex. Are they still +3 and +3? Phosphorus is more electronegative than boron and "loses"  two electrons in dative bond, so maybe it's +5 for phosphorus and +1 for boron?

I'm sure that the answer is simple, but I simply can't find it.

A couple of other folks, including Adam Goldberg, wanted to help and added leather jackets from their personal collection as well. I know leather jackets aren't raw denim, but there has always been some crossover within the community. And this is a really good chance to pick up a nice jacket at a very low buy-in, with even better odds!

The jackets up for grabs are 2 [SOP x Nine Lives Emperor Riders Jackets,](https://www.heddels.com/2017/11/snake-oil-provisions-celebrates-four-years-yak-anaconda-skin/) a Medium and a Large, as well as a [Mister Freedom Ranch Blouse "Ringo"](https://misterfreedom.com/products/ranch-blouse-ringo-black-veg-tan), size 40.

We are selling 50 entries for each jacket, $50/ea for the Emperors and $25/ea for the Ringo. Details on the raffle can be found on Instagram at the following posts:

**(Although we strongly suggest checking the** [**sidebar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/about/sidebar) **(for  mobile users, go to the top of the subreddit front page, click the   three dots and select "community info") and the wiki before posting!)**

Fit checks and "Help me find a pair of Jeans that has X, Y, and Z" questions are a great use of this thread.

**(Help figuring out what size you wear is also permitted here   but it is recommended you check out one of these tutorials on how to size before asking.)**

* [Our recently updated wiki on sizing](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/wiki/sizing)

If you have questions about how your jeans fit, about a particular   fabric, when is this jean coming out, where can I find jean X to try on   in state Y, what jeans have this fit with these measurements, what  jeans  fade the fastest, what jeans fade the slowest.

No question is too simple for Simple Questions. Bashing people will   not be tolerated and "Read the Sidebar" is not a valid answer here!

Also, we recommend sorting this thread by new comments.

Leslie Knope, a bureaucrat in the Indiana Parks and Recreation Department, hopes to improve the appearance of her town by assisting local nurse Ann Perkins in converting an abandoned construction site into a public park. However, what ought to be a relatively straightforward project is thwarted at every turn by oafish bureaucrats, self-centered neighbors, governmental red tape, and a variety of other obstacles. Leslie's coworker Tom Haverford, who takes great pleasure in using his position for personal benefit, is more likely to thwart her attempts than to assist her, while her employer Ron Swanson, although being a bureaucrat himself, is vehemently opposed to government in any form.;https://www.reddit.com/r/scuffed_entertainment/comments/y13idz/which_parks_and_rec_character_are_you_quiz/;/r/scuffed_entertainment/comments/y13idz/which_parks_and_rec_character_are_you_quiz/;self

One "big" X1 box and two additional "small" boxes. All 3 use coax.  One of the small boxes stopped working so I called support. They did resets and even trying the box on other known working coax ports the one box would never work. This was over several support calls.

I requested all new boxes as I wanted 4k boxes. I was told all 3 would be coax boxes as I explicitly said I do NOT want Flex boxes. Well what I received was one "big" X1 box with 4k as expected, but the 2 small boxes are labeled "Flex" and have no coax ports.  My account now shows all 6 boxes as either an X1 or an "Additional TV" box - nothing about Flex.

So first question is - do "small" coax boxes with 4k even exist?  Secondly, should I be concerned my account doesn't list these as Flex boxes?

I bought it used and it is still working.  It is an old modem and tops out at 286 Mbps and I currently am on a 1.2 Gig plan.  For what I do, it seems like the speeds I am getting are fine, as we don't do much streaming and typically don't have a lot of computers in use at once, but maybe I don't know what I am missing.  Having voice limits the modem selection since you need an EMTA modem (unless there is a way I don't know about how you can use a regular modem and still get voice), so I am just checking to see what you guys recommend right now.  I don't need built in wi-fi as I have a router which is probably to have a separate one, and I don't really want to spend $300 on something like the Netgear CM2050.  What about something like the [Arris SBV3202](https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-Telephone-Certified-SBV3202/dp/B07GXSYYHN/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=arris+emta+modem&amp;qid=1665619496&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjU4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;sprefix=arris+emta%2Caps%2C163&amp;sr=8-14) that Amazon currently has for $89 today?

I have the chat logs, but summary version is that I was attempting to negotiate my old plan rate which had gone from $35 -&gt; $83.  I was reassured by the online agent that they had "raised a ticket" for me and my rate would be restored.   They gave me a ticket id number and everything and said it would be resolved and I would hear back in 24 hrs.  

10 days pass and I call support this time, and they tell me they work in the same department and there are no tickets to be raised, and that they must have been lying to me, there is no way to extend my current plan rate.  How can I follow up on this?

Problem is I can't reach it. I've tried removing the paddle by pressing a screwdriver down several of the holes, but I can't find any pressure plate. I've tried sliding it towards me, and away from me, but it's completely stuck.

I tried opening the washing machine from the top, hoping to reach the paddle from there. But getting to the drum that way seems quite daunting since I have zero experiance with this, and I couldn't find any YouTube videos demonstrating how to do it.

Small flames were visible until I turned it off. Then it slowly stopped glowing. 
It still seems to work fine, but I am afraid of burning down my kitchen when using it again.

Professional repair is almost as expensive as buying a new oven. So I tried to take a look at it and saw that the heating ring has some kind of crust(?) that seems to have caught fire. 

[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/CCHAuDP)

The oven has a pyrolysis mode for self-cleaning. Can I use it to "repair" the heating ring by burning off the crust? Is it safe to have flames inside the oven since it is made for pyrolysis or will I burn down by kitchen? Did anyone else ever experience such a strange crust on a ring heating element?

The model is an IKEA Bujublad from 2014 / Germany.

t3_y25lsw;t5_2qh84;1665585349000;1665623736905;How to handle IP address changes with IP address target type for NLB/ALB;I have a somewhat classic architecture with a internet facing ALB targeting EC2 instances in private subnets in different AZs (diagram below).

We have a request from a client which:

* doesn't want its traffic to go through the internet
* doesn't want to leave its "home" AWS region

We decided to

1. deploy a VPC in the client "home" AWS region
2. create VPC peering btw our main VPC and the VPC in the client's region
3. connect via PrivateLink btw their VPC and our VPC (same region)
4. create an endpoint service with an NLB in client's region listening on TCP 443. The NLB will target an internal ALB in our home VPC which will target our EC2 instances

This looks ok to us on paper but when implementing it, it raises several questions on how to handle IP address change.

1. AFAIK, In the NLB, I cannot use the target type "ALB" as it lies in a different region. So I must use the "IP address" target type. But what happens if ALB's private IP address changes ? Do I need to use a lambda to monitor it (like before the ALB target type appeared) ? Can I use the private DNS to target my ALB ?
2. Other possibility would be to have the internal ALB in the same region as the NLB. But then I must use the IP address target type as well to target the EC2 instances and I have the same issue if their IP address change.
3. I believe NLB have an static IP address. Another solution would be to have the NLB target another NLB in our VPC. It would look like: NLB (endpoint) --&gt; NLB --&gt; ALB --&gt; EC2 instances
4. Same as 3 but without ALB so NLB (endpoint) --&gt; NLB --&gt; EC2 instances. I only really need the healthcheck capability (no http routing, no authentication)

Any comment on the proposed solutions ?

Thanks

Here's a diagram of our architecture. See the bottom for the VPC peering and NLB elements.

The `entrypoint.sh` runs the initial Django commands

```sh

set -o pipefail  
set -o nounset

# Django commands
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput  
python manage.py migrate

```

The Nginx config is bare-bones

```Dockerfile
# nginx/Dockerfile

RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d
```

```conf
# nginc.conf

}

server {

    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header     X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_redirect       off;

    }

    location /static/ {
        alias /code/staticfiles/;
    }

    location /media/ {
        alias /code/media/;
    }

}
```

I feel there's something so obvious that I'm missing! Why is it complaining that the "docker" process is missing?

t3_y2cgur;t5_2qh84;1665601614000;1665623736905;Elastic Beanstalk stuck updating environment.;I'm working on deploying an application on Elastic Beanstalk (a node.js/express server containerized with docker, running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2/3.5.0 ), and tried to update some environment properties, and now it's stuck saying "Elastic Beanstalk is updating your environment." for about an hour now, with the environment health just on a spinning grey wheel.

Any action I take basically just results in an error including something like "Environment named \*\*\* is in an invalid state for this operation. Must be pending deployment." This includes trying to abort the operation, terminate the instance, and even delete the application entirely. I've also tried reducing the auto scaling group size to 0, as I had seen on some other posts online that had fixed similar problems, but this did not work for me.

I honestly really don't know what to do at this point, it just seems completely stuck. Any advice would be appreciated!;https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/y2cgur/elastic_beanstalk_stuck_updating_environment/;/r/aws/comments/y2cgur/elastic_beanstalk_stuck_updating_environment/;

t3_y2eflm;t5_wm2x2;1665606226000;1665623739572;Official GARD Protocol Statement on Dusting;**Original Announcement (and poll)**: [https://twitter.com/algogard/status/1580287798120439809](https://twitter.com/algogard/status/1580287798120439809)

Dear #algofam

Did you receive a txn from us?

Our team sent two from a legitimate #GARD wallet: O2QZGRZIMWBVOZEQ64NY2HBHYXN7RP7GRG2DKTNMXFPARX2X7YYI4NZ42E

Our intent was to invite all governors to take advantage of $GARD staking APR on our V2. We’ve just started deploying our Aeneas Grant for \~1 week, compared to AlgoFi who has been deploying Aeneas since December of 2021 and Folks Finance since their launch.

Hats off to the 725+ users who are staking $400k GARD that have heard our message loud and clear. They are currently earning a 66.8% APR (at the time of this tweet). 

While we appreciate that this rate of return is not sustainable in the coming years once our Aeneas funds run out, it's important to highlight that this APR also factors in the protocol revenues that are paid out to our stakers and will always be there to be earned.

The ability to “dust” accounts has always been there on #Algorand and is something we’ve considered doing several times in the past. There was so much opportunity on our platform that we finally had to take action. 

We appreciate that we shouldn’t have sent a link in our first txn and will NEVER do so again. If dusting is a real problem that #algofam is worried about, then we should all work toward a future solution together. 

Cheap transactions come at the cost of being able to "dust" accounts. There is no underlying risk to receiving ALGOs in your account.

We appreciate that some loud spoken members of #algofam are frustrated with us, however, we believe that this, more than anything, may illustrate that there is no real privacy on-chain and that data is accessible to anyone. 

On a separate note, we are conducting a poll to conclude whether #algofam would appreciate us sending real value to users via such a message in the future:

Would you be excited to receive such a message with a meaningful amount of $GARD or $GARDIAN from the GARD Protocol?

\- Yes, dust away!

\- No, stop!

We have been listening to all of your comments, public and private, about what we have done and what we should do moving forward.

It would be appreciated if you could fill out our poll above to help us guide future efforts.

It is also worth noting that there have been some parody accounts that popped up as a result of our recent on-chain messaging efforts that are in no way affiliated with the GARD Protocol.

We will never DM you first. Please stay safe out there #algofam;https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/y2eflm/official_gard_protocol_statement_on_dusting/;/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/y2eflm/official_gard_protocol_statement_on_dusting/;self

So far I'm loving it and having a blast, but looking at other characters, I saw that the edgy eyes I want, are "Void Sight", further research shows me that they are from the Dragon Lord package, which you get from "Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: Chaotic Great Edition".

...This is where my problem comes in, on the store page, there is no option to upgrade my version into "Chaotic Great Edition"; and looking up the question online, all replies I'm seeing are just "Just buy the seasonal pass".

The Seasonal Pass does, at least according to the store page, not contain the Dragon Lord Pack.

So, do I understand this right, that if I actually REALLY want the Dragon Lord pack for my character, I would have to actually... contact Steam and have them DELETE the game from my account, then buy the game AGAIN with Chaotic Great Edition?

t3_y2kfam;t5_2s8wn;1665621104000;1665623739881;Thoughts on a 3V/5V DC Grid to power smart appliances?;Hi everyone,

I don't like the idea of constantly charging smart devices or replacing wasteful batteries, so trying to design/buy things that will be wired to a charger or power source. I'll be designing this home from ground up, so I have the ability to wire every device to a power source when walls aren't finished. It's a 90 square meter house.

Would it be possible/logical to feed all the 5V from one main source and run cables through the house? It would be quite a bit of resistance from the wires alone - I ran some basic numbers and for 120 meters of cable, the resistance would be around 4 ohms and 1.5A / 6W would be the amount fed to the wire resistance (It's been some time since I did any physics)

Another option is to just feed everything locally and more strategically place DC power sources, while this option is saner, it's much harder to design for and finding quality power sources that won't hiss like cheap usb power sources

Then there's low power sensors that use 3V - Does it make sense to connect these to the 5V grid with step down circuits?

**Basically I'm wondering whether this is a solved problem, and whether there are any projects / approaches I can look at, or whether it's all together an illogical thing to work on**;https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/y2kfam/thoughts_on_a_3v5v_dc_grid_to_power_smart/;/r/homeautomation/comments/y2kfam/thoughts_on_a_3v5v_dc_grid_to_power_smart/;self

The cabinets are all up and I have multiple wires ran and hooked up to a switch, but everything I find that is smart, colored, and would fit under the cabinet is a plug-in. I've included a pic of my kitchen set up, the X's are where the wires are sticking out. Every cabinet has its own wire, to avoid having to cut the bottom lips in between the cabinets.   


Just wondering what hard wired solutions others have found that can be hard wired? So far all I've been able to find are home depot brand light strips, but they work on a remote so they're not really automated.

t3_y2e4w4;t5_2s5m1;1665605544000;1665623739889;API endpoint to determine if Organization billing is Invoiced?;hi folks,

i have a GitHub app that many large orgs can't install with a paid option, due to their Organization being billed as a Github "Invoiced" customer.

we have a workaround for this - i ask them to install our free open source plan, then they subscribe via CC with our Stripe portal.

but this naturally has some dropoff, as not everyone sees our FAQ about installing as an Invoiced customer.

so my question - is there a way to determine via any of the billing or other API endpoints whether an Organization is an "invoiced" customer?

i've browsed the [Billing API docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/billing#about-the-billing-api), and while there is nothign explicitly about this, maybe one of you know of some "hint," like a key/value pair that only exists for customers who are, or are not, invoiced.

Hello Im pretty new Minecraft player and I discovered recently every time I peek at my map in mapviewer I loose interest in the game.

So i want to do a blind playtrough. I was wondering if anyone would care to find a map for me.

My ideal map would be **badlands** near **warm ocean**. **One closeby village and atleast one tree** not to far from spawn.

It would be extra nice if spawn would b at **0;0** or really close so the compass would show at map centre.

Cheers!

For me, I have an interest in cybersecurity so that’s why initially I wanted to work in the industry. Now I’m working as a SOC analyst but I’m looking to plan for my future.

When my interest in cybersecurity first arose, I always liked the idea of becoming a pentester but now I’m actually working in a security role that interest has wavered. Since then, I’ve been thinking that I want to progress, but don’t know what to. As such, the role has now dropped in priority and the money has taken its place. I still have a lot to learn in my current role but obviously you always want to look forwards.

Right now I’m earning just under £40,000 per year which is great considering I’m in my mid 20s and I’m sure a lot of people in any industry would be happy with that salary, I know I am. But as the saying goes, life is good, but it can be better.

Jokes on them. They have no idea I'm actually a tremendous moron.

But. I've noticed some flaws for the engineering team and have opened up several tickets in my first week there, and it seems like people just don't like me very much due to it. I hope it's not my general demeanor, instead! I'm super respectful, but maybe that comes across as disingenuous.

Thing is, before I just would have ignored it and not paid attention and just done my job as best I could while ignoring the flaws--but, the flaws lead to seriously bad SIEM and XDR alerts, for which they are VERY behind SLA for NUMEROUS clients.

But, also, in my previous position, I kind of just did the bare minimum, then this new guy showed up and started asking a lot of questions like, "Uhh, why is this XDR platform not working right? Why aren't these alert filters functioning properly?" He just pointed out a lot of things, and to me it seemed genius, but in a good way. He was so driven to fix these mistakes, whereas I was like, "I dunno man, fuck it, it's just broken." So, I started trying to emulate what I respected in him, in my new position.

So, I'm getting thrown on the other alternating team that happens to be working every single holiday, and it kinda feels like retribution.

In any case, besides all that, any tips on getting along with new coworkers? I'm not the most socially skilled, but I sometimes get by.

#  Announcing Candy Machine v3

 Today, the Metaplex Foundation is excited to announce an all-new version of Candy Machine, v3. This is the third major iteration of the leading minting and distribution program for launching NFT collections on Solana. With this update, developers gain more flexibility and control over their minting contracts.

 To add more flexibility to Candy Machine, the program has been separated into two separate contracts. One contract will hold all the minting logic for the Candy Machine, and the other will hold all the access controls. With this separation, most changes you make to your Candy Machine will occur in the access control contract, called Candy Guard. By doing this, you can change the Candy Guard contract without breaking your Candy Machine minting logic.

The Candy Guard contract’s modular framework was built with flexibility in mind. The contract is prepackaged with stand-alone modules, making it easy to adapt the contract to specific NFT use cases. One module that is provided is the allow-list guard, which gives you the ability to specify the mint date and discount price. In addition to the prepackaged modules provided, the contract is highly adaptable, and makes it easy for developers to add custom access controls and other features. 

To get started, [view our documentation](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/overview).

So why not try my hand at building a static analyzer for Solana programs, with detectors for various vulnerabilities? As I started to get an idea of what vulnerabilities I needed to detect, the overall attack surface I saw in Solana programs just seems to be in the form of account validation, which isn't typically the kind of analysis you'd do in a static analyzer. I also looked at the list of detectors in Slither (a static analyzer for Solidity smart contracts) and realized most of them don't apply to Solana either from the strictness of the rust compiler or Solana's lack of all the random APIs involved in Ethereum development. 

So I'd like to know what kind of vulnerabilities exist for Solana programs that aren't simply forgetting an if-statement to check a pubkey. E.g. in Anchor account data needs to be manually reloaded after a CPI.;https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/y1fx4v/brainstorming_a_static_analyzer_for_solana/;/r/solana/comments/y1fx4v/brainstorming_a_static_analyzer_for_solana/;self

I've only today learned there are other options, and that some of the features I'd like are not available with S+.
One thing I really miss is QoL improvements to the Hover Skiff. I'd like it to be at least less fuel demanding, ideally requiring no upkeep at all.

Super Stuctures seems to be the only mod ever made that adds any substancial Hover Skiff tweaks, and even in simple .ini-editting to boot.

I have not really set up any of the 'dedicated storage' or auto-pulling systems in my current game, but once I do, I think I am pretty much locked in.
I've only really use the .ini configuration settings to expand storage space, and even if SS is very limited in that regard, PUI could cover my needs in the short term.
One thing I do like from S+ is the snappy saddles inclusion, but that is available as a separate (but possibly outdated) mod.

So I could make the switch from S+ to SS. But what I really want is to go HAM with the skiff; put a whole base on it! But neither mod has Snapping Points for the skiff, and do get that OCD tendency to allign everything just right.

Furthermore, you have to tinker a lot with the finer parts of‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­your list to find what best works for you! Anyways I lost a lot initially, but kept with it just for kicks, and over these months I’ve been steadily getting better and better at playing the deck to the point where I have completely won my last 3 fnms in a row in a store with a competitive meta. It’s just nice to remember that mtg is a skill that you can hone and actually get better at even with a tier 2 deck and I’m just really happy about it :))) Also here’s [my list](https://www.topdecked.com/decks/dredge/a233965c-3fb1-410f-a191-637a29017176) (don’t judge my off color fetches);https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/y2j6lx/i_mastered_my_modern_deck/;/r/ModernMagic/comments/y2j6lx/i_mastered_my_modern_deck/;
t3_y2hx9t;t5_2xs5t;1665614549000;1665623740190;Thinking about 4c Rhinos... maybe a bit too much;I have temur rhinos and was considering upgrading to yorhinos, feeling good that I didnt bc of the ban. 4c rhino looks pretty good to me though and I might just do that. The 4c rhino deck rn is pretty unanimous (I think) and as someone looking to build it, I am very curious about the lands it uses. All lists ive seen run 4 \[\[Misty Rainforest\]\], 4 \[\[Flooded Strand\]\], and 4 \[\[Wooded Foothills\]\] as their fetches, with 1 \[\[Steam Vents\]\], 1 \[\[Temple Garden\]\], 1 \[\[Stomping Ground\]\], and 1 \[\[Breeding Pool\]\] as their shock lands, and 1 \[\[Xander's Lounge\]\] plus 1 \[\[Indantha Triome\]\] as their triomes. Almost all lists run the same extra lands, and I don't think I have any problems with that. However, I have never trusted popular lists and am almost always looking for a way to do things differently.

The question I'm asking is, essentially, if a different set of lands will work the same way. If I have 4 \[\[Misty Rainforest\]\], 4 \[\[Windswept Heath\]\], and 4 \[\[Scalding Tarn\]\] as my fetch lands, I have the exact same amount of each color I can fetch, just in different orientations; I still have 8 cards that fetch blue, 8 cards that fetch green, 4 cards that fetch white, and 4 cards that fetch red, just like the popular list. I can see no reason to do this other than the fact that these fetches are cheaper, but I also see no reason not to do this; is there something I'm missing that makes every single list run the same thing, or is my line of thought acceptable?

The shock lands and triomes are even more interesting to me. I don't understand why 3 of the 4 shock lands have green in them, as in 99% of games, you only need 1 green source to win. If I simply swapped the 1 \[\[Temple Garden\]\] for 1 \[\[Hallowed Fountain\]\], I would have more blue mana than green mana late game, which is more important for hard casting \[\[Force of Negation\]\]. You can even argue that you should switch it with \[\[Sacred Foundry\]\], to hard cast \[\[Fury\]\]. You would need to change the triomes in order to do something like this though, because without a \[\[Temple Garden\]\], there is only one sequence of lands that gets you a turn 2 \[\[Scion of Draco\]\], as opposed to the usual, more flexible, 2. This shouldn't be a problem as you can just use other triomes; when running the \[\[Hallowed Fountain\]\], a \[\[Raffine's Tower\]\] and \[\[Ziatora's Proving Ground\]\] should do it, letting you fetch for one of the triomes of your choice on turn one, and then shocking in whatever other basic land types you need with \[\[Hallowed Fountain\]\] or \[\[Stomping Ground\]\]. 

I know there is almost no reason to do this, but things like this really interesting to me, and I love to ponder on them while on the subway ride home. All these changes would make the deck like 100 dollars cheaper or something, and I wouldn't end up being stuck with too many green sources of mana. For those who read the whole thing and thought about it, let me know if I'm just forgetting something super basic that wouldn't let this work.;https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/y2hx9t/thinking_about_4c_rhinos_maybe_a_bit_too_much/;/r/ModernMagic/comments/y2hx9t/thinking_about_4c_rhinos_maybe_a_bit_too_much/;

Right now, it's a Rakdos vampire tribal deck that has a focus on benefitting off of combat damage and creature death. I'm not particularly tied to the Rakdos colors if other colors do better, but I do enjoy the vampire theme. I'm thinking about adding White which would be fun. I know in Modern I can go for crazy fast wins, but I'm looking for more of a casual thing.

[Decklist](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/P0mATs7j0E2Bm7unLS7vMg)

Notable changes:

4 \[\[Inquisition of Kozilek\]\] for disruption  
4 \[\[Witherbloom Command\]\], replacing Grisly Salvage (considering splitting 3x1 respectively)  
1 \[\[Grave Titan\]\] as an additional reanimation target (considered \[\[Titan of Industry\]\] )

It is very scary to realize the situation, even in sandbox you feel so alone. This is what we call a "liminal space", it is a place you are familiar with but not how you remember it. Like, the office in Boneworks it is very familiar but pretty weird. As if, something is there controlling the situation but they can't get it right. Control, that is one factor in why it is scary, the area is familiar and you know people should be there but you can't control that. Because you expect a certain thing to happen, but you realize that certain thing dosent happen. Familiarity, another factor in this fear, it is so familiar but it is off. Now to the Backrooms connection, the connection is that it is familiar but off.

We have members of the department that at times have large block of work that are easy to schedule but they also have many smaller things they are required for that take only an hour or half hour to complete. My boss wants to have us schedule out 40hours a week but this would require looking at all the .5hr edits they might have to do on tasks that end up as 4-5 hours just for editing someone else's work. Not to mention other small tasks that may come up during the week that only take 15min here and there but they add up.  


How do you deal with scheduling or budgeting time for people around large numbers of small tasks and make sure that they can still meet realistic deadline dates?

t3_y2dlxz;t5_2r66p;1665604333000;1665623740405;Military Veteran transitioned to a Government Project Delivery role. Am I being too harsh with contractors?;So joined as a Project Support Officer on a graduate scheme to Project Manager with the Government. I've been in for a month. As part of our work, we are managing a Contracted company who are to provide us with data regarding the service they are providing to the public. This is to measure SLAs and other such detauls

The problem is the first reports they submitted were of poor quality. I'd say optimistically speaking there was 5% of info provided in line with contractual SLA monitoring.

My Veteran way of thinking, I decided to create a spreadsheet with reports clearly outlined, headings, and relevant data that we want to see (quite literally SLA by SLA). My experience is that not being absolutely clear with what you want is the cause of disaster. What's more, the absolutely dreadful state of the initial reports means the company is actually behind and in violation of the contract. I wanted to say this is what we want, this is the data and this is the reports we want. This is the bare minimum to get it in line with contractual obligations. Without being harsh, I also emphasised it was collaborative. 

The problem comes with a meeting I had with the account managers which my line manager (who is generally great) also attended. Now I was friendly, polite, and all that jazz. The issue came when the account managers seemed to think they only had to provide one form, and the rest of the data (which again is wildly off the mark with SLAs) was to supplement us. And it was produced in PDF.

Naturally I said we wanted Excel to rip data and reporting to be in line with what we require for governance. the Account Managers also said that they may not be able to provide some SLAs. At that point my Line Manager jumped in and undermined me in my opinion being relatively wishy washy rather than emphasising the expected standards. 

This is a Government role which means heavy oversight and the need to justify public money to oversight boards. Am I completely out of wack with Project Delivery in civvie street? Is absolutely outlining what is expected considered a faux pas? Any other advice generally on this issue and working with contractors?;https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/y2dlxz/military_veteran_transitioned_to_a_government/;/r/projectmanagement/comments/y2dlxz/military_veteran_transitioned_to_a_government/;self
t3_y2cbgm;t5_2r66p;1665601251000;1665623740405;What is a good approach for a project that seems to keep shifting;Summary of the situation:
- project has been ‘in-progress’ for 4 years and managed by 2 PMs previously
- Outgoing PM and Sponsor repeatedly mentioned the project is ready to launch, and I just needed to get a pilot going (…?…)
- process, charter, schedule and every other document described something very different from SME, stakeholder, and exPM discussions
- After getting a barebones pilot launched, I re-analyzed, re-designed, and started to re-launch the project
- every meeting with sponsors and stakeholders introduces some change to the project, that could address some new need that was not mentioned before
- Most resources for the project, end up being an account holder for x platform or ‘doesn’t know anything’ and I end up doing most of the effort for many tasks

The actual question:
What are some good approaches here? I actually want to bring this to life, but it’s starting to look like a project looking for a need to exist and a sponsor that’s keeping it on life support. 

Conversations where I’ve tried to bring this up with the sponsor, usually end up with them dismissing concerns, being overly positive about what’s possible, or highlighting my lack of familiarity with x business unit or y subject matter.

Not sure if there is simply a problem with me being pessimistic and need to improve on delegation skills. Or if there’s something just fundamentally wrong with this project and team.;https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/y2cbgm/what_is_a_good_approach_for_a_project_that_seems/;/r/projectmanagement/comments/y2cbgm/what_is_a_good_approach_for_a_project_that_seems/;self

TLDR - getting wife a Cricut Maker, what should I get her with it to get her started OR should I buy a combo from Cricut?

I'm pretty much decided on buying my wife a Cricut Maker for Christmas. Briefly, I also considered the maker 3 and camoe 4. Maker 3 seems like more money for pretty much no additional functionality. I have read a bunch on the reasons people recommend the cameos over Cricut but in the end the Apple to Android analogy made up my mind. This will be her first cutting machine so I don't believe she will be a power user that will be severely limited by Cricut's app and the ability to easily design on an Ipad and print it appeals to me. IF she becomes limited and feels like she would rather the Cameo I will gladly sell or rehome the Cricut and buy her that.

So with that out of the way I have moved on to getting her some accessories to get started. I know some of you will say just get her the machine and let her add things as she needs them but I know my wife. She hates spending money on herself despite making plenty of it and will likely hesitate to buy the things she wants and end up using it less for that reason. Because of that I don't want to just buy her the machine. Based on the math the combo deals on Cricut's website seem to be a good value but I have seen people say to not get those and piece meal it. If that is the case what should I buy her?

What are the must haves, nice to haves, not really necessary, etc things to get someone off the ground. I'm asking for input on all of it, blades, vinyl/paper?, tools, accessories, etc.

Right before week 1, Adam Schefter started a big fantasy hype train around him as someone who will be involved in the offense - likely as the Rams primary 3rd down + 2 minute drill back. 

Williams hurt his ankle on the first play (special teams) of week 1. He was placed on  IR and declared out for 6-8 weeks.

A user has connected his outlook pop3 mailbox to his iPhone Mail app. Due to the latest Microsoft authentication policy I have to change the authentication settings of the aforementioned outlook mailbox to make it functional again. The trick is that even though -for storage reasons-  we have deleted his mail history past a certain time, the iPhone Mail app seems to have retained the whole history of the mailbox (I guess locally or through iCloud) which is something the user does not want to lose. So the question is how do I disconnect and connect the mailbox having updated the auth settings and without losing any of the mailbox history?

TL;DR: hosting a party, want to premix 2 or 3 cocktails and would like your recommendations what to make!

I have been making individual cocktails for entertaining with great success, with some favorites being espresso martinis, Trinidad sours (love love love), Negroni sbagliato, a lot of rum drinks I hadn’t known about. I’m finally hosting a bigger party, probably 30+ people. I’ve got analysis paralysis! So looking to y’all for advice. A couple things to consider:

- I’ll borrow a margarita mixer machine that can keep 2 drinks cold (probably not cold enough for frozen drinks or any ice)
- I can make super lime/super lemon juice no sweat (thanks to this sub for that)
- We’ll be serving one drink in blood bags out of a mini fridge, so a naturally red one would be awesome but I have food coloring otherwise
- looking for crowd-pleasing rather than the deep cuts I enjoy
- Already decided to do a hot spiced cider that folks can add bourbon/rum to individual cups to their heart’s content

Please halp! We’ve got the decorations on point but this is a piece I’d love to nail. Love you guys ❤️

Very happy with that result, and my machine is gorgeous. 

I feel like a complete mug now, because it turns out after all that, I really don't like Vertuo coffee! I tried most of them from the taster pack that comes with the machine as well as some of my own order. It just isn't as good as the original at all. It's so bitter and the crema is disgusting.

My wife and I received a Nespresso Vertuo as a house warming gift and I was super excited to try it but so far I’ve found all of the coffee pods to be extremely bitter. 

Does anybody have recommendations for what pods I should buy for an extremely light roast? 

I always add sugar and creamer to any coffee that I have but even when I add an unhealthy amount to the Nespresso, it is still on the bitter end. 

Is Neapresso just not for me or am I buying the wrong pods?

I live in the US and have been strict about Covid precautions (masks, avoiding crowds, fully vaccinated etc.), and will continue to be as cautious as possible. Even though I am a huge foodie, I haven’t gone to a sit down/indoor restaurant in over two years. I usually order take out nowadays or make food at home. This is relevant because when I go to Japan, one of biggest things I want to do is explore the incredible cuisine. But frankly, I am still uncomfortable with the idea of going into a sit down restaurant and taking my mask off in a crowd. If it’s an option, I would rather take restaurant food to go.

Besides conbinis, is restaurant take out common in Tokyo and Osaka? This would be good to know so I can plan (or delay) my trip accordingly.

Sorry if these are newbie questions. I realize Japan has just opened for tourism again and the various covid vaccine/testing requirements are fairly clear.   


Questions:  
Am a US citizen, and would like to go for some extended travel. 90 days seems sufficient to start. However are there options to extend that are simple? I have looked online and get a bit bogged.

I wonder if anyone knows about simple longer stays in more natural areas. For now, the only thing I can think of is to fly to Tokyo, stay somewhere to rest a bit (am older) and then perhaps go to Kyoto for some Ryokan stays. Is it possible to do this on the fly, or do I have to make sure I have reservations well in advance? I am somewhat flexible and can afford medium (not crazy expensive) places.

Does anyone know anything about Buddhist monastery stays for more than a night or two - I'm wondering where is the best place to look/be, and if one can just stay simply and perhaps observe, although I cannot sit for longer periods in meditation, just physically.

Are there any simple places to go near nature with things like Ryokan and easy food possible, to just be for a while and rest/recover. I am currently on the edge of homeless in Seattle, and I would like just to visit somewhere else and be for a while, and I have long wanted to visit Japan.

Or should I fly in and go straight by train to someplace like Kyoto? I am barely surviving the US, and would like to just go, stay by myself in a simple room, eat easily and simply, and partake of a different culture. 

I'm in my early 60s and would like to know if my usual backpack way of travel is ok, or if a suitcase is better. I have a day pack as well. 

Thank you, and sorry if these are redundant. I'm somewhat afraid right now and it makes it hard to plan and make decisions.;https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/y2jlw8/overwhelmed_newbie/;/r/JapanTravel/comments/y2jlw8/overwhelmed_newbie/;self

I find that through the website you can find better deals and promotions. However I’m not sure that if the Japanese websites did require a phone number would an oversea number be okay? And will they accept an international card, or would I need to use my wise multi currency card?

I’m heading to Japan (thank you work) for my third visit next month and I’d like to  explore more of Chubu. The Tokyo portion I’m more or less happy with as I’m just revisiting old favourites,  I’m just not sure whether I’m spending enough time – or too much time – in Nagoya, Takayama, Kanazawa and Nagano (and whether there are any must-sees that aren’t on my list). Any help would be hugely appreciated! (I’ll also be getting the Hokoriku Area Tourist pass on 30th Nov).

I'm also conscious that whenever I go to Japan I end up destroying part of my body so I'm going to take my time looking round places.

\*Quick Edit - I also collect goshuin, so if anyone has any recommendations please do let me know!

20th November – arrive in Tokyo. Sleep.

21st November – Harajuku/ Pokemon Centre

22nd November – Odaiba for Teamlab Planets

23rd November – Asakusa/Akihabara (this day I can potentially move to when I’m working so I guess this day is an extra one to play with really)

24th November – Tokyo to Kamakura; take a look round Hachimangu and Komachi-dori

25th November – To Hase for giant buddha and walking trail

26th November – Enoshima for the day

27th November – Kamakura to Hakone (I’ve been to Hakone before but I just want to see the damn shrine that I missed last time really...)

28th November – Hakone to Nagoya

29th November– Nagoya (castle, railway museum)

30th November – Nagoya up to Takayama (Showa museum, shrine, folk village, that area around there)

1st December – Shirakawago for the day/half day

2nd December – Takayama still - Matsuri no Mori museum; maybe go to Gero onsen for the afternoon?

3rd December – Takayama up to Kanazawa – see Kenrouken, Oyama shrine, Craft museum

4th December – Ninjadera in the morning, then Kanazawa to Nagano (Zenkoji)

5th December  - Yamanouchi monkey park/maybe Shibu onsen? (To be honest I’d quite like to see Togakuchi which looks like a day-trip, so not sure whether to have an extra day here and sacrifice a day somewhere else)

6th December – Nagano to Tokyo to start work at like 3pm

6-10th December – work

11th December – Takaosan for the day  (I guess I could also slot in a day trip to Hakone here instead!)

Will be in Japan late this month and I have a tight schedule and am trying to maximize time in Kyoto while hitting Fuji Q Highlands the next morning. I assume going straight from Kyoto to Fuji Q early in the morning is too long, so I'm thinking we should stay somewhere closer to Fuji Q that puts in in an easy access for the next morning. We have the JR rail pass.

If I want to stay in Kyoto until around dinner and leave via shinkansen maybe by 7pm or 8pm, where is best to stay? I know it'd be best to literally stay somewhere outside the park but that does seem like a rather long trip (of course, we can do it if that's the best recommendation, I just hope not to leave Kyoto too early.)

For instance, do you recommend staying near Mishima Station, for instance? It looks like there'd be a bus that would bring us to Fuji Q Highland that morning if so. Or is there a better spot, with easy train/bus transportation to the park in the morning?

Also - we would head back to Tokyo after the park. Can we store big suitcases in lockers at Fuji Q? Or should we stay in a nearby hotel after all in order to safely leave our bags there?

Questions:   


* Am I spending too much time in Takayama? Its my first time attending a festival so I'm not exactly sure if I need more time to spend there since things might be hectic. 
* Based on my itinerary, it would make sense for me to get the 21day JR pass right? 
* Any recommendations for stay in Kamakura? I would prefer to stay in a hotel instead of guest house so that luggage forwarding can be easier. Most of the recommended places seem to be guest houses.

Is my plan feasible? Really wanted to spend a day in Onomichi as I've heard that it's more than a jump off point for the Shimanami Kaido.

 Any Suggestions Welcome! I love running so running routes or cities in the Itinerary with scenic running routes appreciated.  Also I'd love to stay at Ryokans, but they're a bit expensive, I can probably stay at 1 or 2 in this trip max. Are there any specific places in my trip that would be the best place to stay at a Ryokan?

EDIT - Will a JR Pass for all of Japan be the cheapest option for me? It costs around 200 USD on Klook.;https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/y22sda/9day_itinerary_check_fukuoka_shimanami_kaido/;/r/JapanTravel/comments/y22sda/9day_itinerary_check_fukuoka_shimanami_kaido/;self
t3_y1zt1z;t5_2uylr;1665568866000;1665623740932;Hydrangea season;Hi all, I would love to visit Japan for hydrangea season. I've already been during spring and fall (for context, I've visited: Tokyo, Yokohama, Takayama, Matsumoto, Kyoto and Osaka). 

I'm aware that hydrangea season falls during tsuyu months and it will be wet and humid a lot. It's just a personal goal of mine to do hydrangea viewing in the places that are known for it. I've also narrowed down the potential stops on my rough itinerary to Tokyo and Kamakura (3 days Tokyo, 1 day overnight in Kamakura before returning to Tokyo) and Kyoto (3 days).

My question is more towards the timing. I've read that the season lasts from mid-June to mid-July. Would it be better to go in the latter half of June or the first half of July? Also is there anything else I should also consider/check out during tsuyu season in Japan?

t3_y2j4cu;t5_2syix;1665617619000;1665623741203;My first Gig (need advice);So I started mixing since corona started and just mixed for myself as a hobby. A few months ago I decided to try find gigs n started giving out my number to promoters just in case they need an opener (small clubs 10-50 people). Lo and behold, I got called by a big company to DJ for an event for 6 hours every few days to around 1000+ people for upcoming month or two. Now its not a music event, but they want me to play in the background while stuff is happening. The pay is good so I took it (I must be out of my mind).

So currently Im stuck with trying to find songs that people with different backgrounds will enjoy and well I have no experience playing in front of large crowds besides house parties.

Lastly, they expect me to bring my own equipment other than speakers and I only have a DDJ SB3 n headphones n wires to connect to mixer or speaker.

The gig is in a month and my anxiety level is reaching new heights.

My current solution is to play music through my laptop speakers instead, but I can’t figure out how to configure a headphone cue through it as well.

Info: I had my first VERY OFFICIAL gig 2 months ago at a small techno club (with my DJ Name on the Flyer hahaha) and many people asked for my insta or if there is more stuff from me somewhere online after my set. And my answers were "no" and "only old mixes". This shall not happen again!

Next month is the next BIG gig and until then, I want to have more online presence established. It's a huge opportunity for me to kick ass on the decks (that wont be the problem) and hope to impress some promoters (or ladies) so I get more invites!

Total newbie to DJ’ing &lt;18 months &amp; think this could be a unique way for showing your skills etc. - And with the right equipment I.e., a decent battery power supply, decks &amp; laptop obvs and one of those standalone Bluetooth 2 plug into. Why couldn’t not be done?? 

Not sure if or of any legalities regarding permits, as never done anything like this before - however any advice, thoughts or anyone knows of people’s that have done this type of thing before? Hit me up! Very keen on exploring this.

I currently work on a back-up team where we handle a pool of voicemails and emails for adjusters who are out sick or on PTO. For some reason this week we have gotten a MASSIVE influx of voicemails and emails from insureds absolutely bitching about their deductibles and demanding they be waived.

One of the actual emails we received today:

“I’m not at fault so I will not be paying my deductible. I heard I can request for my insurance to waive my deductible, consider this my formal request to do so.” 

Today alone we probably got 40+ emails/voicemails of people complaining about their deductibles across about 35 adjusters. Everyone of them demanding they be waived and saying “I shouldn’t have to pay it if I’m not at fault, the other insurance company has to pay it.”

Of course we have had this before but never this many! Even when I handled my own personal claims this was like a 1/500 issue.

I am in Tampa Florida. What is the consensus on using Geico recommended shop vs my own shop. I know they are individual shops, but I worry they will put one over on my to benefit themselves and the insurance company. Plus, I do not know if they are on average worse because they are better for doing things at cheaply as possible. My own puts me in control and I could pick someone who might be more reputable, but there are less guarantees. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Mazda 3 2019 that was damaged. [https://lensdump.com/a/RzVOb](https://lensdump.com/a/RzVOb)  Photos here. I thought about getting 2 or 3 quotes at both Geico places and my own to see what they say.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are two Geico recommendations that I looked at.

I'm using a messaging service (Twilio) to send messages to users. 

 Basically, I run a route &gt; 300 messages sent to 300 different phone numbers

Now the problem...

For each 300 messages I made it so I get a webhook back to see if the message is delivered or it failed. I update the result in my db.

Twilio sends message near instantly so I usually get an instant 300 request to my server. My server is littered with this warning after running the send route. 

(node:19592) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 end listeners added to [QueryBuilder_PostgreSQL [object]]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit

and doesn't update all the number (usually gets like 10% of the numbers before it decides to stop updating)

How would I handle this ? Currently I just temporarily removed the webhook.;https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/y2l8w9/how_do_i_allow_my_express_rest_server_to_handle/;/r/node/comments/y2l8w9/how_do_i_allow_my_express_rest_server_to_handle/;

t3_y2euc1;t5_2reca;1665607188000;1665623741212;Zurau, an Apache Kafka visualizer;Hey guys!

I'm working with a team of developers ready to launch [Zurau](https://www.zurau.app), a fully featured open source Kafka visualization app that's launching through the tech accelerator [OSLabs](https://opensourcelabs.io).

[Health Metrics Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/3qft0d9prft91.png?width=2872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f3925c3bfbbc4e4ce4aabf2d5688072a3195a1)

Zurau is built with a React front-end library and a standard Node.js/Express back-end. It uses Socket.io to open up a binary connection that facilitates data queried with Prometheus using PromQL. This enables the data to be visualized on the frontend using ApexCharts. In order to structure and test Zurau, we Dockerized a Confluent-provided Kafka cluster image and used a JMX Exporter as an intermediary to expose its mBeans. Zurau also features Slack integration where developers can set custom metric thresholds so throttled notifications can keep them up-to-date with the health of their Kafka cluster.

Check out our [Medium](https://nicholasechevarria.medium.com/introducing-zurau-an-all-in-one-kafka-monitoring-notification-app-for-devs-c5a13b7d95d) article for an in-depth look at Zurau!

[GitHub](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/zurau) | [Zurau](https://www.zurau.app) | [Youtube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjO1mNr_6aU)

Please spin up Zurau locally and let us know with any feedback you may have!

Using NVM to switch to a newer engine like Node 14 for install throws an error of incompatibility with some dependencies.

 My scenario… VLAN A and B create mDNS traffic. VLAN B and C consume the traffic. I want to limit which devices can talk to VLAN C specifically AirPlay advertisements. I can’t think of a good way to block these. 

A few ideas I had but don’t think they’ll work or are possible:

* convert multicast to unicast and filter the unicast. But what does the conversion?
* some sort of IDS rule the sniffs the packet and if it sees it is Airplay and from a specific source, drop it. I have no clue if this is possible.

My primary goals are for more granular DNS resolution and VLAN capabilities than my ISP-provided router comes with.

I purchased a Protectli Vault to be used for OPNsense, which has four ports on the back:

- WAN
- LAN
- OPT1
- OPT2

I also have two network switches that I'd like to connect to my network:

- A non-POE switch for wired devices that aren't POE
- A POE switch for wired devices that are POE-capable (this is where my wireless access point will be plugged into)

By default, I have WAN and LAN interfaces in OPNsense, which correspond to what I've plugged into my Vault's WAN and LAN ports. 

At the end of the day, I'd like all of my devices to join a single network (192.168.123.xxx), and then manage their access to other devices via VLANs.

So here are my questions:

- Do both of my switches need to be plugged into my Vault, or should I plug one into the LAN port, and then connect the second switch to the first switch?
- Do I need additional interfaces beyond WAN and LAN to accomplish what I'm trying to do? I can't quite figure out what to use different interfaces for, and Google isn't helping.;https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y24pwk/looking_for_some_guidance_on_the_optimal_way_to/;/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y24pwk/looking_for_some_guidance_on_the_optimal_way_to/;self
t3_y20hur;t5_3lx1g;1665571235000;1665623741482;Beelink U59 Pro or Better Hardware Recommendation?;Hey all,

I'm looking for hardware recommendations. Budget under $300. Home office with lots of video conferencing, multiple people watching 4K streams, youtubing, gaming, etc. Standard stuff. I may want to try adding wireguard in the future, perhaps some DPI plugins.

ISP gives me a bit over 350mbps down, 9.5mbps up. It'd be nice to be able to "grow" with a speed increase later down the line, maybe up to 1gbps (or a practical 800mbps anyway).

Currently using a J4125 mini PC with proxmox+opensense and it's usually great ***except*** ***that*** video conferencing tends to kill one of my ethernet ports, which is ... a dreaded USB-to-ethernet adapter. Yeah I know, I blew it.

So I'm hoping to find something that will actually work now. I found a mini PC called "Beelink U59 Pro" which has dual gigabit internal adapters and an N5105. But as far as I can tell, the adapters might be realtek rather than intel. Supposing I intend to send them as passthrough's to opnsense, which would allow proxmox's debian based OS to handle the drivers.... would this work well? (current setup uses passthrough as well, but the USB nic still dies)

Anyone worked with this model? Recommend something better? I just want to buy something that actually works this time. But something small, compact, easy. I don't want to build a mini-ITX server or have something large on the desk.;https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y20hur/beelink_u59_pro_or_better_hardware_recommendation/;/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y20hur/beelink_u59_pro_or_better_hardware_recommendation/;self

From what I can tell the only option is Zenarmor Sensei, but I cant really tell if the free version will do what I need or not. and I'm struggling to figure out how Layer 7 works on OPNsense at all. 

The way I currently have Untangle setup is I have rules setup to check for traffic from certain apps or services, and when it detects traffic from a client that matches a rule, it will tag that client automatically. I can then setup any number of rules to act upon the client based on what tag it was tagged with. Then when the traffic stops, the tag is removed automatically.;https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1l6yk/what_free_options_are_avaliable_for_layer_7/;/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1l6yk/what_free_options_are_avaliable_for_layer_7/;self
t3_y1jdlp;t5_3lx1g;1665519864000;1665623741482;Quick howto: Marking packets for policy routing;Hey!

This is a quick howto on how to mark packets in a way that can be picked up by OPNsense in order to control how they get routed. In other words: How to make your traffic use a specific gateway. Why would you want this? Multi-WAN, selective VPNs, whatever floats your boat.

Policy Routing is done by setting the Gateway in a LAN filter rule. But up until recently, the choices to match on were limited. src/dest address/port, protocol and all the basic things. Nothing you could easily influence from outside of OPNsense. With a [new feature](https://github.com/opnsense/core/commit/a002251146709a34eebf294bff076a3329253698) introduced in OPNsense-22.7.5 this became more powerful.

It's possible to have the sender tag packets with something called DSCP. This is meant for [QoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/quality-of-service-qos/qos-packet-marking/10103-dscpvalues.html) but we can abuse it for routing purposes. Since the sending machine is setting the tags, we gain a lot of flexibility. Do it per application, per user, whatever you can set.

**Step 0: Set up your gateways in OPNsense**

Not gonna explain much here, you should already have multiple gateways if you're interested in this. See [here](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/multiwan.html) for some guidance.

**Step 1: Tag your packets**

Let's say I want all traffic sent by user `lihaarp` on a Linux box to go through gateway `VPN_01` on OPNsense. I've chosen the `af21` DSCP class for no reason whatsoever. On the Linux machine, add this Iptables rule to tag these packets:

`iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner lihaarp -j DSCP --set-dscp-class af21`

~~For Windows machines, [Quality Windows Audio/Video Experience (qWAVE)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/qos/quality-windows-audio-video-experience--qwave-) might help do the same. Untested.~~ see comment below

**Step 2: Match the tag**

In OPNsense, create the policy routing rule on the LAN interface. Set the *Gateway* from the dropdown menu to `VPN_01`. Press *Show* under *Advanced Options*, and set *Match TOS / DSCP* to `AF21`. Move the new rule before the *Default allow* rules.

**Done**

That's literally it. Tagged traffic now uses the set gateway. Thank you /u/retiredaccount for telling me about this and thanks to the OPNsense devs for implementing it.

Caveat: ISPs might do priorization based on DSCP tags ([some background](https://www.fabian.fyi/2020/05/websocket-dscp-embiggened.html)). And unfortunately, Iptables doesn't allow you to set just any value (`Invalid DSCP value: foo`). So maybe stick to the `afxx` values found in the Cisco link above.;https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1jdlp/quick_howto_marking_packets_for_policy_routing/;/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1jdlp/quick_howto_marking_packets_for_policy_routing/;self

With a monitor and keyboard I was able to boot into single user access mode, mounted the file system as read/write and renamed the old config.xml so it would not load on boot. Now I have a clean system and start over. First thing I did after configuring my WAN and LAN port was an auxiliary LAN port in a different IP range with DHCP activated so I (hopefully) will be able to access the GUI if anything breaks again. Next thing is to activate SSH shell access for easier troubleshooting

\---

Alright, I did it. I broke my Opnsense lol. Like an IT toddler I tried out stuff I didn't really know about and now I lost access to the machine.

It's not a big deal, I only got it a few days ago and played around so far. So no production disaster yet.

What I did so far was configure interfaces. I had 2 WAN interfaces for ISP and failover ISP, 1 LAN interface and one additional interface that was not yet enabled.

For the purpose of learning how to work with OPNSense,I connected the WAN interfaces to my regular router where it received a DHCP IP address.

The LAN interface was my playground, where I connected my laptop and configured things like DHCP, DNS, and a few other things.....

Then I started setting up VLAN and that's where I lost access.

All the machine does it's respond to ping on LAN. Ping from WAN does not work. Access to the GUI is not possible. Access to the console is not possible because I did not enable access with password.

So I guess tomorrow I'll start from scratch, if there are no other ideas....

Next time I need to take some precautions. Don't tell me, I should have known 😂🫣;https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1ekpy/i_managed_to_lose_access_to_my_newly_installed/;/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/y1ekpy/i_managed_to_lose_access_to_my_newly_installed/;self

Hope everyone is well. I am looking for some advice on a decent home safe to get to protect my collection. I’ll probably end up posting this on both r/Silverbugs and r/coins

I have been a somewhat long time silverbug and coin collector throughout my childhood. I have been using nothing but lock boxes and crap home safes that I could afford with my budget. I am still young so money is pretty tight for me but it’s been a priority of mine to upgrade my protection for my stack for a while now. 

As for going about looking for a safe I do have some odd parameters, I apologize. I recently I received $400 in Amazon gift cards as a gift, so I would say I’m limited to buying from Amazon for a safe as I do not currently have the money to buy one elsewhere. I have been researching for the past few weeks and have narrowed down some options. I did figure I would turn to Reddit however to hear some reviews and or advice on any decent home safes. 

Currently I am looking at this fireproof sentry safe 2.05 cubic foot ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/SentrySafe-SFW205CWB-Fireproof-Waterproof-Combination/dp/B00HS3NI4W?th=1&amp;psc=1). I don’t have the budget or really room for one of those massive home safes as of now. One day I do plan on purchasing one though. 

Does anybody have any advice, opinions or reviews on any good starter safes for a young collector? Let’s say a $450 range on Amazon (as I would be willing to spend some of my money I’ve saved). I read the reviews on a lot of these safes on Amazon and they all seem pretty bad, like very machined and poorly crafted but it’s the best I can work with for now. Any help would truly be appreciated.

To me it seems pretty obvious that I mean for it to be a date even though I didn’t actually use the word “date,” but I’m not sure. Both of us are very shy and don’t have great social skills (we talked about this when we got coffee), so it’s possible that she doesn’t realize that it’s a date. 

After doing some browsing and reading posts from people in similar situations, there seems to be two general consensuses. The first is that it’s best to just use the word “date” when asking her out to avoid any confusion. Unfortunately it’s too late for that cause I already asked her. Other people say that it’s better to just not label it as a date and just see how it goes, and that if both people are flirting, it’ll basically turn into a date. My problem with that is that because we’re both shy and inexperienced, neither of us really know how to flirt.

I guess I have the option of clarifying that I meant for it to be a date while we’re at dinner, but that might make her feel uncomfortable if she doesn’t think it is. Should I just try flirting and see if I can gauge her response, and if it seems like she’s into it, go for a kiss at the end? Or would that be inappropriate unless I clarify that it’s a date first?

I gave it to him out of panic and have been texting him everyday since. We don’t text a lot or anything. And it’s usually it’s just an exchange of a few messages throughout the day. 

He’s the one that initiates the conversation every time. The conversation is not flirty or anything and normal. He is my coworker and would not like to engage with him romantically like that. I posted something relating to this about what we text but many people were saying I should stop texting him or tell him right off the bat that I am not interested in him. 

In my mind I was going to tell him that I was not interested in the moment that he starts to flirt or ask me out. But many people have said that I should communicate that to him asap so he doesn’t get the wrong idea.

t3_y2kcjk;t5_2s4kl;1665620903000;1665623741602;Spend way too much time thinking of what to say;I (26M) have a huge problem where whenever I am talking to someone I’m interested in my entire days become consumed by trying to keep up with them over text/snap. I’ll get a message from them and just stare at my phone for up to 30 mins sometimes just thinking of what to say back, nothing comes naturally to me it is all very calculated. If I’m at work and trying to come up with a response I’ll often just stop working and go hide in the bathroom to stare at my phone until I think of something to say. If I don’t I find myself unable to work at a good pace because I’m so sidetracked by responding. There’s usually a lot of pressure considering how quickly I reply because if I don’t sit down and exclusively focus on what to say 3-4 hours can easily pass where I haven’t replied to something very trivial. Often times when short term relationships end I have a huge sense of relief that I don’t have to hover around my phone all day putting a ton of mental energy into trying to say the optimal things to whoever I am dating at the time. In my ideal world the person I’m dating and I text/snap just a few times a day until we’ve been dating for a month or two then we can start FaceTiming and stuff. I like talking in person 100x more and my personality does not translate over text.It’s so easy for someone to lose interest in the talking phase if I’m not on top of responding at all times, at least I feel that way. Several years ago I thought this had to do with the other person, that we just didn’t connect and that’s why I can never think of anything to say naturally, but I’ve dated so many people since then and have realized I am this way with everyone. The only people I can just carelessly respond to without thinking about it are my good dude friends and that’s because there is 0 pressure about saying something weird or giving an ick. Even if I say something weird, they’ll still be my friend. I say one weird thing in the talking phase with a woman and it could easily end there. I know I need to have the confidence to just say whatever comes to my mind, but I always beat myself up hard about being boring or weird.

I am 24M that goes on tons of dates, like yesterday I had two. So its not problem for me to get dates through OLD. But I get rarely second dates. The problems is that I just go to these dates for the sake of going, not really seeing if I really like the girls I go out. Well, I never know if I like them physically, I just go because its better than nothing. When the date comes I just feel that its forced, because I just go because its better not to go rather because I like them physically. I do have some problems being witty, I can hold conversations, I can 'make moves' but its very difficult because I rather dont feel confortable at dates. I know that I like girls, but I only have been atracted to 2 girls in my life. I just dont know what to do: I feel rejected, idiot, not fun, a loser because even if I try to carry the conversation, the girls just dont seem into me. Neither am I.

t3_y2dztm;t5_2rbn0;1665605215000;1665623741665;Please help me check if I'm a British citizen already;Hello there,

*First of all, I usually only ask on reddit when I can't find the answer on Google after doing my research. I have read a lot and even found some information on the British* [*gov.uk*](https://gov.uk/) *website and I've been reading for days.*

I was born in 1988 in Germany where my parents and some relatives are. But my parents immediately sent me to Hong Kong where I stayed with my grandma between the age of 0 - 1.5 years. I had a "permanent resident stamp" on my very first German Passport as a baby. I received my Hong Kong ID 19 years later.

My dad was born in HK in 1960 but has a German passport as well. Every time I renewed my passport or ID the German officers would remind me that I have dual citizenship, at least it's stated in their computer system.

So am I already a British citizen? Would I only need to apply for a British passport or maybe I am eligible but don't have British citizenship yet?

I believe people who were born in the '60s in HK are considered “Citizen of United Kingdom and Colonies” (“CUKC”) and had no ride of abode according to The British Nationality Act 1948 (in force from 1 Jan 1949 till 31 Dec 1982.). I believe they wouldn't have any rights to pass down their British status on to their children. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something;https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/y2dztm/please_help_me_check_if_im_a_british_citizen/;/r/HongKong/comments/y2dztm/please_help_me_check_if_im_a_british_citizen/;self

t3_y2javb;t5_2tcp9;1665618108000;1665623741728;Server Wipe;Hello, I've currently got a 1.19 SMP running. Although many if not most of the players stopped playing because they've fallen behind or "there's nothing to do". There are about three that still consistently get on though mainly one who's on 90% of the time as he's building his farms. 

I also feel I should mention I forgot to set limits for what people could as far as going to the nether or end yet, etc, etc. **Is this a good idea?**

I'm not opposed to different playing styles, but building farms for everything is new to me.

Anyways, I surveyed the player base and am currently looking to survey more. One question was would they want a wipe? Basically, everyone has said yes besides the one gentleman who's creating his farms, etc. I think a wipe wouldn't hurt as we're a month in and as no one plays, restarting on mods with limits should help to keep players engaged longer(theoretically).

The question: Should I wipe the vanilla for a modded? I'd save the world to maybe look at later, but we'd be fully modded otherwise on a fresh world. I do have the option though to just create a separate server instance on Ptero, I'd just close down the vanilla presumably,  or lower its ram as likely no one will be on it.

This didn't happen on Aternos and that server was  way less powerful and often lagged with out redstone and what-not.  What's wrong, is it a setting I have to change or the Linode server  itself super unstable?

t3_y2c9yd;t5_2tcp9;1665601167000;1665623741728;Looking for advice on Vault Hunters server;Hello all!

It has been some time since i managed a server. My wife and I decided to play Vault Haunter.

So we downloaded the server &amp; clients and started playing. Not much to say on that.

We played for a week until the server started to lag a lot.

Even to the point where is normal to see these messages even when no one is logged in.

&amp;#x200B;

    [20:51:13] [Server thread/WARN] [minecraft/MinecraftServer]: Can't keep up! Is the server overloaded? Running 2471ms or 49 ticks behind

    [20:53:36] [Server thread/WARN] [minecraft/MinecraftServer]: Can't keep up! Is the server overloaded? Running 3441ms or 68 ticks behind

I did the normal stuff like give it more ram, ensure cpus are ok, disk etc.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference I run the server on a windows machine with 32GB and amd ryzen 9 3950X

With a Geforce  RTX 3070 Ti

&amp;#x200B;

On ram config I have given it even 20GB at some point without much improvement and now is running on 8GB.

I ended up adding the newrelic java agent to monitor what was going on, since I don't see any specific resource being used a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

In the NR ui i get a 49% cpu usage (i'm guessign is only using a few cores?) since my pc reports a 3% usage.

Threads are stable at around 90. my used heap is stable at 6GB

And the GC cpu time is in the 0.02%

Disk is on the 0% (ssd)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really finding where the bottleneck may be and running out of options. Btw is not just the message the lag is noticeable playing the game.

Any advice is appreaciated!

Don't worry, us too! Thankfully the team behind atmospheric first-person horror adventure game "[Scorn](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/scorn)" have dropped by with some 'spooky-season approved' goodies for us to lavish upon you.   


What is Scorn you may ask? Well, it's a game - so good news there we are in the right community. It's also hitting Gamepass and the Xbox store this Friday at the following times!

&gt; Scorn is set in a nightmarish universe of odd forms and somber tapestry. It is designed around the idea of "being thrown into the world". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. Every location contains its own theme, puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.   


Want to actually see some Scorn? Don't worry, I've also brought a trailer!

I've already tried searching around on Google and am not seeing an answer to my question. I have an Xbox One. The last two games I've bought on the Microsoft game store have had major bug issues to the point where I can't play them (Martha is Dead and Little Hope). I usually buy hard copies of games, so I wasn't sure if there's a higher likelihood of glitches if you buy digital. My Wifi is great so I know it's not about that. I've tried uninstalling the games, clearing save data, clearing cache, hard reset, the works. Nothing is fixing the glitches. Should I just stop buying from the store and always buy physical? I've never had issues with hard copies before, never have had glitches like this until buying from the store. I'd appreciate any insight or help.

1 - You will need to force Google Chrome to enable rumble support. We can do it enabling a specific experimental flag. Just write or paste this on your search bar:

chrome://flags/#enable-android-gamepad-vibration

2 - Inside chrome flags menu, look for "Gamepad Vibration" option. I think it will be the 1st item in the list. It should be on "Default" or "Disabled", set to "ENABLED".

3 - Close and relaunch your browser.

4 - Go to Xcloud website and log in normally.

5 - Click on your profile picture, scroll down to Controller Vibration setting and make sure it's enabled.

6 - Test any game just to see if it's working correctly.

7 - It should work normally. If it still doesn't work, try to force close and relaunch your browser again.

Usually the bengals run scheme is straight zone or zone with pulling guards. Teams have figured it out this year. 

Now though we are running back just straight pulling one guard and then down blocking the other guards which makes the linebackers wait a extra second while reading it. Our blocks are shorter now. We have variety with our running scheme.

t3_y2l9tv;t5_4761s9;1665623409000;1665623758670;About sacrificial;So I understand the reason people dislike the sac book is because nahidas E is very short, like 6 seconds on hold.

However it's also a very quick to cast skill you just hold, wiggle the mouse, and release and 8 peeps are hit with dendro for a while.

so is it just not viable to do it twice? cause like 9 times out of 10 you'd be able to use it before the cd would normally end and its not like you have to manage the seed that hard because it lasts 25 seconds and a recast would reset it anyway.

it would just be a quick source of extra dmg no?
maybe even an immediate spread if you use someone like raidens E. just hold E, wiggle (their immediately quickened), then hold E wiggle for a cheeky little spread before you move on and it'll take you like an extra 2-3 seconds max but you'll get a spread so it's kind of worth. (even if you don't use raiden and don't get the spread you still hit them with another instance of the initial skill hit)

it just really dosent seem like that much of a useless passive. not to mention the cd isn't that long especially if you just gonna use it when you have to re-apply the seed it'll basically always have 100% up time you hit multiple enemies with it so the procing ain't gonna be an issue kinda similar to sucrose aoe.


I'd just like to hear opinions, do you really think it's THAT useless compared to like magic guide, cause it has a decent amount of atk as well and nahida still needs atk so magic guide just ain't completely convincing me.;https://www.reddit.com/r/KusanaliMains/comments/y2l9tv/about_sacrificial/;/r/KusanaliMains/comments/y2l9tv/about_sacrificial/;self

Edit: With GD buff and her being lvl 90, she has about 985 EM. I want her EM to be decently high due to both her passives.

And just for clarification, im using her as an off-field dendro in a aggravate comp.

In a given day, how do you structure your classes and research?

For example, do you research first and then do a little bit of each class, do one classes HW per day and then research in small blocks during the day, etc?

For myself, I have noticed that after 4 or so hours, my brain starts to get tired and I can't do much else. Meaning, the first 4 hours of work will be the best quality and after that I trail off. Should I research the first 4 hours of working so that that's top quality for example?

- Prof. Jane Doe
- Readings [covered/provided an overview of/explored] existing scholarship from anthropology's "ontological turn" and its dissidents;
- Final project entailed writing, recording, and editing a video essay on animal bodies in the gallery space [should I add a link here? should i elaborate on its relevance to the work i'd like to do in grad school?]

Model: 14ARB7 - Type 82QF

Specs:

\- AMD Ryzen 7 6800 U with Radeon Graphics

\- 16GB RAM

\- IPS Screen 2240x1400

\- 512GB storage

\- OS: Windows 11

&amp;#x200B;

Major issue:

1. Freezing

\- at least 1-2 times daily, the computer will freeze with no warning at random.

\- i'll need to do a hard restart using the power button.

\- all drivers are up to date. windows is up to date

\- I've performed the system file checker, the disck check, DISM and the windows memory test - all with no issues identified.

I have lost work multiple times due to the freezing.

Does anyone know how to troubleshoot or fix this? I write down exactly what time it freezes but i'm not sure how to troubleshoot what happened beforehand.

The reliability checker just says "windows did not shut down properly"

&amp;#x200B;

Other issues I have noticed

1. Microphone is extremely soft

\- When testing in settings it works at 1-2% of max volume even when i shout

\- most apps are ok, but the Your phone app is completely unusable because people can't hear me.

2. Keyboard has slow response whenever a lenovo website or lenovo vantage is open

\- i literally have to type at 1 key per second, otherwise it will register every 2-3 keys i type.

3. When I shut the laptop lid, it can often spend hours whirring and getting very warm.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it has been a bad experience. If anyone has come across these issues before or has ideas, please reach out!

I will probably have to return this laptop more than likely.;https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDLaptops/comments/y21uzq/lenovo_yoga_7_gen_7_serious_issues/;/r/AMDLaptops/comments/y21uzq/lenovo_yoga_7_gen_7_serious_issues/;self

I just snagged a good price on a **ASUS - ROG Strix G15**.  It is the  Advantage Edition with the AMD Ryzen 9 **5980HX**, and the nice Radeon **RX 6800M**.  I purchased from Best Buy (Model G513QY-SG15.R96800, SKU:6486485) in the United States this month (October of 2022).  It has a 15.6" QHD screen, an okay 512GB SSD, and "16GB of DDR4 memory."  \[By the way, the same model is currently still available at Best Buy for $1,099.99.\]  My machine seems to have the liquid metal issues worked out, and I haven't fried it yet-- but I'm just not sure about the "16GB of DDR4 memory."  


**My question is, is there any way of knowing exactly what level of memory I actually have (without opening it up and finding the stickers)?**  


I know many, many machines built around this time suffered from supply chain issues and shipped with less-than-ideal memory.  Jarrod's Tech, Hardware Unboxed, and other review channels have noted that their machines shipped (in 2021) with 1Rx16 sticks that (as one might expect) had slower sub-timings than 1Rx8 in the slots.  


I ran ZenTimings and I seemed to have obtained mixed results.  


*The good news is, I have some great measurements:*  
a tRFC(ns) of 350 (same as JT's good 1Rx8 measurement, while his stock 1Rx16 was 550)  
tRFC of 560  (same as JT's good 1Rx8 measurement, hs 1Rx16 was 880)  
tRFC2 of 416  (same as JT's good 1Rx8 measurement, 1Rx16 was 560)  
tRFC4 of 256  (same as JT's good 1Rx8 measurement, 1Rx16 was 416)  


*The bad news is I have some poorer subtimings, too:*  
tRRDS of 9 (same as JT's STOCK 1Rx16, his replacement 1Rx8 was 4)  
tRRDL of 11 ((same as JT's STOCK 1Rx16, his 1Rx8 was 8)

Unfortunately, I have no idea what subtiming numbers mean, and I don't (yet) have an external monitor I can use to check frame rates (this laptop has no mux switch but the DP over USB-C to an external monitor does bypass the iGPU) so I can't compare apples to apples with benchmarks.  I know I'm splitting hairs here, but I don't want the GPU to be bottlenecked by something as simple to fix as a memory upgrade.  


**So, it seems the memory I have stock is not as good as the new memory Jarrod used, but is better than the stock memory that shipped in early 2021.  My question is, how much worse and how much better?**  


If I were to upgrade the memory, I would go ahead and bump it up to 32GB to have more headroom for the future.  **Is it worth bumping up now, and if so, what is the fastest memory that my machine can utilize?**;https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDLaptops/comments/y1a57k/how_bad_is_my_memory_2021_asus_rog_strix_g15/;/r/AMDLaptops/comments/y1a57k/how_bad_is_my_memory_2021_asus_rog_strix_g15/;self

Been testing it for personal use and for channel - and I get system hangs like this randomly when doing stress tests 

Like gaming on dota , or davinci edits - or even sometimes YouTube videos (though I fixed this with turning off hardware acceleration) 

Unsure if just new device and driver issues or faulty

It's a very appealing laptop. Compact, light, convertible, 32GB LPDDR5 option, U series, pen support etc etc. But the screen options suck. The LCD option is a weak 300 nits, and the 400 nits one is OLED (OLED still sucks for longevity).

I'm a first year graduate, so not sure if it's still commonly used in schools anymore. I might be looking into it too much but I'm curious what other teachers think about this?

t3_y2idae;t5_n8n6o;1665615689000;1665623759225;MvC2 Second Thoughts?;Anyone else having 2nd thoughts about their MvC2 purchase?

I preordered the cab and even from the very beginning I had my reservations about it. I figured I would buy it from Best Buy, wait and see. I just got a notification that it's being processed but also reading and seeing many of the reviews online from people who got the cab, I'm def on the fence now more than before and may just end up returning it without even opening.

There's 2 big issues I see with the cab:

1) The inability to play online vs people who have the older MvC1 and X-men vs Street Fighter cabs. This is a pretty big deal for me, net play is a must because playing these games alone is not great. It appears they used a different game file for Marvel vs Capcom 1 (and the other games?) so the games completely desync randomly (one person's game continues while the other is over) from each other making it unplayable. More info on this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBMw43aJq3I

This cuts out a lot of people from the ecosystem and it's pretty massive oversight. For this to be fixed, A1up would have to release an update to the older cabs which patch over the existing legacy game file, I don't see them doing this, they're not great at supporting their online games, there is still input lag on Big Blue even though a fix has been readily available created by the community, I did the fix and it was so easy, I do not understand why this wasn't just simply patched. No reason why A1up can't fix issues like this when random dogooders online can do it for free.

This leads me to my 2nd reason:

2) No net play for MvC2. With how terrible the response to Blitz has been, I'm skeptical about A1up's ability to offer netplay at all or trust them to release a version that won't be full of issues. Without netplay, I cannot justify spending $599 for this, it's a deal breaker for me.

This is unfortunate because Big Blue (despite the input lag) and the new Yoga Flame and Shin Hadoken cabs have pretty damn good net play and the community is strong, same with MvC1 cab. Not sure how A1up screwed things up so badly.

With how much hype this cab has had, I'm curious to hear others' thoughts on this.

t3_y2f6nv;t5_n8n6o;1665608001000;1665623759225;Big Blue/Xmen mod update/advice;Stuck again. I was able to create a new apk package name for the xmen apk as well as rerouting all the local files to use this new directory. On startup, it asks me if I want to use 1Up or Xmen, much like the Simpsons/Turtles mod.

However, controls do not work in the games. You can move in the menu and select games, but this uses short and forward kick, which are already routed to left mouse click and right mouse click. So the new apk loads but cannot detect controls. When I uninstalled the original Big Blue apk update and put the Xmen update on top of it, the controls worked fine.

So the controls are likely sent directly to the original .arcade package file, and changing it means it no longer works. If I can find whatever is sending the inputs to the app, I can probably add a line to also send it to my clone.

Another issue with this is that I have the input lag reducer. It might also be rerouting those controls. My guess on how it works is that it overrides the original input system, and it reads the inputs and sends them to the .arcade package file. If this wasn't installed, it might work. As of right now, however, I cannot remove it. Uninstalling the app in settings removed all my control, keyboard or buttons. I had to adb install the app again for it to work.

So that's my progress so far on this little side project. If I can find how inputs are read, I should be able to add some lines to send the inputs to the new apk. If anyone has any ideas with this I'd love to hear them.;https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/y2f6nv/big_bluexmen_mod_updateadvice/;/r/Arcade1Up/comments/y2f6nv/big_bluexmen_mod_updateadvice/;self

(also posted on r/OnlineDating and r/AskMen)

So I’ve been talking to this guy that I met online. The day we matched, he asked me out on a date for that day. It was great: he was an absolute gent and we clicked instantly. After the date, it was clear from his texts that he liked me and shortly after, he asked me out on a second. It went better than the first and he even mentioned how crazy alike we are. After a whole day of hanging out, our conversation naturally shifted and he shared some personal stories with me which left him pretty shaken up, and knowing he is emotionally closed off to people, I made sure to just be there for him, listen, support, and be as receptive to him and his experiences as I could be, letting him share what he wanted at his own pace. He then admitted afterwards that it was hard for him to talk about it as he usually doesn’t open up to people. He even said the things he shared with me he hadn’t shared with anyone, ever. I thought it was sweet that he would choose to trust me with this, but when his discomfort persisted, joking that I now “know too much”, I left the date feeling unsure of whether he would want to see me again or not despite us having a really fun time. I remained hopeful however and told myself that yes, he was out of his comfort zone, but he wouldn’t throw our connection away just like that, especially since everything else was going so great. However, I can feel a slight shift in his behavior, but this might be me projecting my own insecurities since he seems to still be open to the idea of us continuing to date.

Now, for the questions: am I overthinking this, or do his continuous jokes of discomfort mean he regrets opening up to me? Men, especially the more closed-off type, how do you feel after opening up to a crush/date/partner for the first time? Do you feel closer to them or do you want to run for the hills? I really like him, he's one of the sweetest guys I know, and I haven’t felt this excited about someone, ever. All I know is I’ve found a diamond in a dating pool of coal, and I wanna keep him around if I can… Please help a girl out :)

TLDR: Clicked with guy I met online who is super sweet, far from an f-boy, and ticks all my boxes. We went on a few dates which were great, but he opened up to me which he’s not used to doing. Now he’s making jokes that I know too much and acting kinda different towards me. What could his change in behavior mean? Am I overthinking it or do you think he might regret opening up to me? Men, how do you feel after opening up to the person you like?;https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/y2kfd7/is_this_normal_for_a_guy_to_do_after_opening_up/;/r/dating/comments/y2kfd7/is_this_normal_for_a_guy_to_do_after_opening_up/;self

We’ve been through a lot like a lot from a cancer diagnosis , other illnesses , deaths in family etc and we still love each-other so much and are so in love but Were on a break right now because part of us feels like we’ve never got to experience being on our own since we were together since so young. We wanna experience different things &amp; people have hookup culture &amp; know what it feels like to live our 20s before fully committing any further.  We wanna make sure we know who we are outside of our relationship bc we grew up together so it’s tough. We don’t wanna be 40 and regret not living life in our 20s especially because we both got hit with some really serious diagnosis this year and although we’re doing better we’re kinda in that I almost died I need to experience it all mindset. We are on good terms still speak at times and miss eachother but we know this is something we need to do so we don’t wonder in the future. But do you guys have any personal experiences with this working out do you think it’s a good idea. There’s a mutual understanding on both ends.

The date went very well, lots of kissing, eye contact and she even reminded me at the end of the night about future plans i had previously suggested. The next day she reached out to me first on sc and we have been in convo since. Since then though she has been pretty blunt/cold. Only a few times she seemed as engaging as she was before the date. I asked her the other day if she was still interested in me and going on another date. She said ‘of course i do’. She was still pretty blunt after this. So i asked her today again ‘are you sure? You seem to nice to tell me no upfront’ and she said that she still wants to see me. Just got no idea whats going on tbh, you reckon i should pull back for a bit? Any advice?

I’m a 25F talking with a 31M from Bumble. We’ve been texting every day but yesterday he left for a trip for 2 weeks. We’ve never met yet. He’s already asked to see me once he comes back, but I feel like if we text all the time we’ll run out of things to talk about when we see each other in person (and that’s if he asks to see me, cross that bridge when we get there). 

Just wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation and if so what did you do?

The origin of your relationship problems may be in your childhood .

I recommend the following book that I will help you discover patterns that may have originated in your childhood::

Well I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 6 months and in all this while he has really been a great guy overall, respects me, shows physical affection and even does fun stuffs with me. But there is this one thing which has kind of bothered me ever since is his aloofness towards my life beyond him or his lack of interest towards what I do otherwise, as in whenever I try tell to him things happening with me regarding my studies or other things about my family or where have i been and such, he always responds with a single word and thereafter the topic ends. The few times i tried bringing up this matter he told me i can just tell him anything and he would be ready to listen but all he does is impassively listen to me and then be done with it (this was initially) and now if i ever bring up this matter he goes on to say "then tell something interesting." 
However, whenever he needs to tell me something of his work or of his hobbies i gladly listen. Am not asking him to exactly give attention like how i do but sometimes some bit of attention makes would really be nice i feel. 
This is what keep me upset at times because i don't know at the long run how "interesting " will i be to him...;https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/y2h867/i_feel_like_my_bf_isnt_much_emotionally_attached/;/r/dating/comments/y2h867/i_feel_like_my_bf_isnt_much_emotionally_attached/;self

All the signs in the end were positive. I feel I did do some mistakes for example when she said she had fun, I cracked a weird joke saying “Thank God I didn’t bore you!”. I didn’t quite say anything in person when she asked “See you soon?” because I started walking away but I did text her later at night and next morning. 

We’re both 30 and I get it that we’re looking for the one. But rejecting people after the first date is truly brutal.

t3_y2birb;t5_2s8e9;1665599391000;1665623759874;Warning For Goorin Bros Support;This is a warning to be careful with placing a Goorin Bros order online

About three weeks ago I placed an order for their very limited drop. Since they sell out within two to three minutes most times, it’s a race through checkout to place your order. This time when I was checking out, auto fill put in my old address for some reason. I had already clicked place order when I noticed and tried canceling or back out before the payment processed, I even closed the app while still on the processing screen , but the order went through anyways.

Not a problem. I’ll just contact support immediately and they’ll be able to change the address or cancel and re-place the order for me. So I immediately reach out, just in case they tried to ship same day. I explained the situation and asked if they could change my address. They got back to me immediately. They told me due to a shipping policy they aren’t allowed to cancel my order or change the address. I replied back saying that the order had just been placed, and I would even pay for another shipping label if that was the issue. They told me no, and that I would have to get FedEx to hold my package at their shipping center.

So I tried placing a hold and they told me it wasn’t possible yet since a shipping label had not been made for my order yet and I would have to wait until my order shipped out to make a request

No problem. The weekend past and then the next week I get an update that my order shipped. Awesome, I can make my request now. I put my request in and it says I will have to wait for it to be processed and approved

A few more days go by and I got an email that my package was delivered??? Not only was it delivered but it says it was handed to the customer? I checked and my hold request was never approved. I reach out to FedEx and a case is created for my issue. I also reach out to Goorin Bros and they said they would also make a case for my FedEx issue

Weeks past. No answer back from either. No update on the hat. No return to FedEx. No return to sender. Nothing. I reach back out to Goorin Bros today wanting to know if there is any update on my order or what I can do. They send a more strongly worded support email this time saying it’s my fault for putting the wrong address in the first place. They said there’s nothing more they’re going to do about this issue, they’ve received their money and it doesn’t matter if I have my product. I follow back up mentioning that they had an entire weekend and days later to change my order address but refused to do nothing about it. I understand if they can’t cancel since it’s a limited item but you’re telling me they refuse to change an address minutes after any order was placed? They came back and said this issue is closed and to not reach out again.

Now they have my money, I don’t have anything, and they refuse to help or give advice for anything I can do. I’ve been loyal to this company for so long and I don’t feel like I should order from them again. If you think their support is going to help you, I would give up hope. Some of the worse support I’ve seen from a company;https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/y2birb/warning_for_goorin_bros_support/;/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/y2birb/warning_for_goorin_bros_support/;self

In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭5:25-33‬ ‭ESV‬‬


After reading this passage, the question I have been asking myself is how can I love my wife as Jesus Christ loves the church.

Giving up myself for her. Saying it and applying it are two different pictures to me. 
Giving up myself, is it more than the request to take out the trash when I don’t want to? Doing the dishes? 

Could giving up myself mean giving in to her will? 

Could it mean giving in to Gods will? 

Loving her as my own flesh. Letting her lounge around after a rough day. When she’s angry listen. Forgive her. Scratch her back when I want mine scratch. 

Nourish her. Take her out on dates. Buy her candy from time to time at the store. Encourage her spiritual walk with God. Partake in the practices she does. Help. Learn from her. 

Cherish her. Hold her. Forgive her 77x7 times. Help her. Study with her. Listen to her logic and reasoning behind it.

Do all these from a place a love. Not from a place of favors. Learn to want to make her happy. Because she is your church.;https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/y2kp10/i_have_to_love_my_wife_better/;/r/Christianity/comments/y2kp10/i_have_to_love_my_wife_better/;

We have natural disasters, evil, and other treacherous things that happen here on a planet that God created.

God could have NOT created anything. He could have continued doing what he was doing before he created mankind. 

Before he created the universe, there was no sin. Sin didn’t exist. 

1. We wouldn’t have death. 
2. We wouldn’t have sin
3. We wouldn’t have fear 

The world would simply be able to avoid all things bad if God never created the universe to begin. 

There wouldn’t be a need for heaven or hell because humans would simply not exist if God never created us in the first place. 

But since he did, there’s all these Godly rules that we have to abide by so that we won’t go down the wrong path to destruction.

Before God created the universe, why did he feel the need to create us.

(NOT a post about disabling dynamic brightness);My Dell XPS 13 9310 has a really neat feature called LACE. When viewing in a very bright environment, it increases the gamma / narrows the dynamic range so that the contrast is increased. Obviously, contrast accuracy is lost in exchange for this extra "artificial" brightness, but it's an amazing feature that gives you extra visibility in extremely bright environments.

My issue is it only works when running on battery, if I plug it in, it's instantly disabled. Does anybody know how to enable it whilst plugged in as well? I've tried Dell support but they couldn't figure it out. I'm hoping someone here might know. I'm not sure if LACE is part of Microsoft, Intel or Dell.

(Please note, this is not a post about adaptive brightness (automatically controlling the backlight based on ambient light in the room). For content creators eager to disable that feature, it's in windows display settings and intel command center. As content creators, I'm guessing you'll probably want to disable LACE as well.);https://www.reddit.com/r/DellXPS/comments/y2dr0d/local_adaptive_contrast_enhancement_doesnt_work/;/r/DellXPS/comments/y2dr0d/local_adaptive_contrast_enhancement_doesnt_work/;self

t3_y23whd;t5_2urh7;1665581082000;1665623759902;HDMI port not working?;Hi All, 

I have a Dell XPS 7590 (2020) that has a problem with the HDMI to monitor recognition. Mainly, I have been using it normally, with both monitors up and running and then it seems to "glitch" out and is now unable to recognize the monitor from HDMI to HDMI. 

I have run several tests: 

1. The USB-C to HDMI works. 
2. The USB-C HDMI converter to HDMI works. 
3. The HDMI itself isn't the problem and the monitor isn't the problem. 
4. I've tried manually telling the computer to extend the display, with no luck. 

I am concerned that is something to do with the graphics capability because at the time that it "pooped" out on me, I had been watching TV on the laptop while running a decently heavy program on the monitor. Keep in mind, I do this fairly often and haven't had issues before. Does anyone have a solution?

I just picked up a WD SN770 on Amazon sale with intent to replace the SATA.  It is PCIE4, although not a super fast one.  Another option is to put it in this 9510.  I'd rather not open it up unless I have to, but would I actually notice a performance increase?  I don't use the laptop for heavy copying of files.  I also heard that SK Hynix tend to use less power than other brands...though I'm not certain with the PC211.  Thoughts?  My original thoughts when I found out about PCIE3 in the 9510 is that if I upgraded to PCIE4, I'd probably use a much faster drive than the WD.;https://www.reddit.com/r/DellXPS/comments/y1o4y0/ssd_question/;/r/DellXPS/comments/y1o4y0/ssd_question/;self

im looking to purchase a cnc mill ( i have a smaller denford running on mach 3 for hobby use) to start out in cnc machining. i have absolutely no customers lined up or business model and starting from scratch. All i know is i really enjoy cad / cam and machining on my little denford and i would like to learn more. atleast if i fail i will have thought myself the use of industrial machines and could get a job in a local shop and sell the mill i purchase.

as for spares / repairs i dont honestly know where id get either repaired.. perhaps a local electrician or the like.

so to that end i dont know what i will be machining - im just after opinions on which would be the better buy for overall usability and rigidness. the haas tm1p has 6k spindle the dugard has 10k and siemens controller. the haas is bigger and both come with atc / enclosure and a good bit of bt40 tooling. i guess what im asking here is if you were starting out to learn cnc which would you choose?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Machinists/comments/y2e5d4/dugard_eagle_450_mini_mill_or_haas_tm1p/;/r/Machinists/comments/y2e5d4/dugard_eagle_450_mini_mill_or_haas_tm1p/;self

As you can see, its pretty much the best AM4 can offer for gaming. Now, I do understand that AM5 has already been released. However, quite frankly, I'm not really concerned about future proofing myself here -- I do not want to be beta testing their new architecture nor do I want to be waiting for others to do so. Also, as far as I can tell, the 5800X3D and the 32GB DDR4 wont be "bottlenecking" my system any time soon (remember: primarily gaming). Do correct me if I'm wrong.

What I am however concerned with is whether or not I will be able to consistently achieve the 240 FPS in 1440p on the games I will likely play, that is kind of the whole point of me spending this much money and getting that particular monitor. Now, I'm not much of a singleplayer -- more of a competitive shooter type of guy. So think games like Apex Legends, Valorant, CS:GO, (((Fortnite))), Warzone, and PUBG.

My Question: With the release of the RDNA-3 cards early next month, should I rather get one of them or is the 6950xt plenty already? The new 4090 from Nvidia is one beast of a card and as far as I'm aware, the 7900xt will likely match or even surpass its performance in the above scenario (1440p rasterized games).

t3_y26evo;t5_2rw0n;1665587293000;1665623759914;A week with the ASrock X670E PG Lightning: my thoughts;As the old adage says - perhaps I got what I paid for. Several of you probably saw [this motherboard](https://www.newegg.com/ASRock-X670E-PG-Lightning/p/N82E16813162068) in [the thread talking about how it's the cheapest AM5 mobo](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xpivlu/the_cheapest_am5_mobo_on_newegg_is_25999_and/). Well, I bought it on October 1st, put a new 7700x build (everything but the GPU, PSU, and case is new) together on the 4th, and here we are today.

Pros:  

* cheap  
* nice aesthetic if you like simple matte black  
* lots of m2 slots  
* BIOS is well laid out, easy enough to interact with  
* when the system is running, no problems at all

Cons:  

* When engaging a RAM overclock (say, to take the [RAM](https://assets.website-files.com/5cdb2ee0b102f96c3906500f/6244ba18dde5121e6494255d_PVV532G620C40K_Sku%20Sheet_032922.pdf) up from the base frequency of 4800MHz to the rated/named speed of 6200MHz, the sleep option just outright disappears in Windows. If you disable this XMP-1 RAM profile and go back to "Auto" BIOS settings, sleep reappears. Infinitely reproduceable, maybe just a new BIOS issue, but even so... a pain. 
 
* I've never seen a system take so long to go from pressing the power button (which you'll be doing a lot, as if you want to use basic RAM overclocks, you can't sleep the damn thing) to displaying the splash screen. I can't imagine what it was like on the 1.03 BIOS revision; the first thing I did was flash the [current 1.07 BIOS](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X670E%20PG%20Lightning/index.asp#BIOS) before installing Windows. However even with on this version, it still takes about 15 seconds, every power-on, after the button press to showing anything on the screen. Annoying, but not the end of the world.

* After particularly long gaming sessions (i.e. the system is pretty warm) when rebooting the system to get back into the BIOS, it has about a 70% of not displaying it at all; i.e. when using the 'hold shift when pressing restart' option to have windows restart the system right into the BIOS; for 3 nights now, after a long gaming session trying to do this exact action, I haven't been able to see the BIOS (I think it's going to it, but the video just stays off). Next morning when the system cools down; getting into the BIOS works fine and consistently.

This is my first time on an ASRock motherboard. Don't get me wrong, **I love the performance I'm getting out of this board+CPU; I upgraded from a 6 year old i7-6700K w/ 16GB of RAM and when playing CPU bound games like Cyberpunk or Star Citizen, this sucker FLYS**. But it's these little, annoying Quality of Life problems that are just making me grit my teeth and I gotta say, I'm missing my old ASUS and Gigabyte builds...;https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/y26evo/a_week_with_the_asrock_x670e_pg_lightning_my/;/r/Amd/comments/y26evo/a_week_with_the_asrock_x670e_pg_lightning_my/;self

I'm looking to brainstorm and understand what everyone would like to see on our side of gaming, regardless of what we have already done and are already working on. This will help us gauge if our current short term and long term plans are on the right path, or if any pivoting is needed. We have a lot of doors open for us, and knowing our audience is valuable towards making decisions that will make the gamers in our community happy.  


**Stay Gaming Focused**  
This is gaming related (if you didn't notice 😂), so the potential core safemoon company products you may be desperately looking for information for, will not be discussed at any length here. Any other SafeMoon related things, I'm not going to get into here. Stay focused on gaming, regardless if it's PC or console, this is your chance to tell us what you want to see or what you expect to see.

This is simply my ears open, listening to you, the community.  To be clear, we have plenty of things in the works for both short term and long term, but we have flexibility right now. We have quite a lot of room to add/remove/adjust/pivot, and the reddit audience is a different portion of the community I've not yet really sat with to gather your thoughts on these areas.;https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/y2inyf/community_gaming_the_road_ahead_brainstorming/;/r/SafeMoon/comments/y2inyf/community_gaming_the_road_ahead_brainstorming/;self

The exchange seems like a very important factor for SafeMoon going forward.   I am thinking that the on ramp, off-ramp and bank account add on would be a significant factor for SafeMoon.   What are your thoughts on it?

I am also supposing that in order to implement an exchange that the logical sequence is completion of our blockchain first.    Is this a likely scenario? 

Lastly, SafeMoon has listed several projects in the works——how probable is it that they would all come to fruition at nearly the same time?   In other words, do certain dominoes have to fall for the others to be completed?

I've got a Razer Core Razer Core X Thunderbolt 3 case (which has 650 Watts PSU) and i cant figure out what is the most high end card i can put in it that will work as an eGPU. The lists that i see online are stopping at pretty old gpus, the days when apple was introducing eGpu support.  
I use a 2019 macbook pro with high end specs, usually gaming in windows bootcamp very rarely on mac.  


As far as i know a AMD GPUs are the ones that work well? Can some of you share what was the highest ent card and from which brand that works for you?

I have a XPS 9500 laptop with 10300H, and only igpu, fhd+ screen.

I do have a Lenovo Booststation, but no gpu at the moment.

What would be the best gpu for this cpu? Or i might go for a better gpu because of the performance loss?

Is VR gaming possible with this setup? How is that set up?
Is it better to have a much more capable gpu because vr needs it, or am i going to be cpu bound?

I do want to use it with an external fhd display.

I did consider something along the lines of rx5600xt (~150€ used) rx 5700 (~170€), or 1070, 1660S/Ti (~130-170€), which are cheap right now.;https://www.reddit.com/r/eGPU/comments/y21lxw/10300h_best_gpu/;/r/eGPU/comments/y21lxw/10300h_best_gpu/;self
t3_y1y1pr;t5_2ukno;1665562626000;1665623760552;Random freeze on Windows 10;I have XPS 13 7390 and earlier 2016 version running Windows 10 and Razor Core V1 with GTX1060. This setup has been running for the past 5\~ years and there's always this random freeze and I have to force shutdown the laptop by holding power button.

From what I can see, it never happen when I'm playing games but most of the times either when having chrome open just browsing or playing videos, coding on VS Code, or simply just idling standby. On some instance when a video is playing (Youtube etc) there will be that loud buzz noise comes out when it freezes. But it doesn't always screaming like that even when having Spotify on.

I can't really pinpoint what triggers it, for some context with the system I'm using I have the old Synapse v2 which I had the v3 for a while but didn't make any difference. Also I have WSL for coding but not sure if that makes any difference otherwise it's pretty vanilla Windows 10 with recent NVidia driver and up to date OS. I just bought a longer active TB4 cable but the original razer also has the issue so I don't think it's the connection.

Anyone has similar issue? Can we fix it?

Also since I have Windows 10 Pro, whenever I had to force shutdown, once it turns back on it will ask for BitLocker recovery code. Every single time to the point I have muscle memory to type the 48 digits code. I know that we can disable it but if we enable it back it will reset the code and I don't what to lose it, is it worth it to have it on/off?

It stutters from 141 (where i have it maxed with G SYNC) down to as low as 70 sometimes, depending on the action in game. This can be quite distracting. I've spent many hours tweaking NVIDIA control panel and in-game settings and cannot pin it down.

The stutters are not correlated with CPU spikes, which I've checked (CPU usage never goes above 45%). 

I've tried removing all peripherals from the USB hub

Tried different graphics drivers

Tried disabling the internal GPU

There's a ton of posts on [egpu.io](https://egpu.io) about Warzone battle royale having framerate drops, but not much about Fortnite.

To introduce myself, I'm a Korean-Canadian writer who also dabbled with translations. I did Korean literary translations in university, but my true passion was in lyrics. BTS was one of my favourite groups growing up, and I would spend my summers in Korea while writing lyrics in my hometown (Daegu, which may be why Suga is my bias!).

I sound like an angry cat when I sing and I don't have much experience in mixing/editing so I'm purely a writer, but I'd hate to see these lyrics just stuck with my voice. I'm also looking for mixers/editors but most importantly, I'm just looking for someone with a good voice and good rhythm, as BTS songs tend to have rap verses too. The only other requirement is that you have a decent mic with some sort of recording device. I used to be in a cover group once upon a time :') and it had fantastic singers with no experience, so I don't look for experience either—just a nice voice. I am also looking for one male and one female singer.

t3_y2agnl;t5_2zqih;1665596859000;1665623760674;Comforting songs?;Hello,

I failed my masters thesis defense. I'm feeling very bad these days. Looking for some good BTS songs to cheer me up. I've been listening to Magic Shop, Young Forever, Blue &amp; Grey and Anpanman. I'm a kinda new ARMY so there may be songs that I don't know about. 

Hoping someone here can introduce me to some good comforting songs.

Thanks!!!;https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/y2agnl/comforting_songs/;/r/bangtan/comments/y2agnl/comforting_songs/;self
