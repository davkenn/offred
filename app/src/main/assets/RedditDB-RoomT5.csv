  Click here to view our full rules on the wikihttps://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/wiki/rules   Posting requirements   You need to be at least 3 days old to post a submission or comment.   You need at least 20 karma before you can post a submission. You can still comment on the sub to get that 20 karma!  If you’re a content creator   And found your work posted here without your permission, please contact ushttps://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl, so we can help you remove it.   Reddit is a public forum; the moderation team can’t keep an eye on every piece of artwork posted to ensure they have gotten proper permission from the artists to be rehosted and modified. We rely on user reports and feedback from artists to enforce this.  If you want to do a promotion in the subreddit   Please contact ushttps://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/furry_irl, so we can discuss the best way to do it per the Reddit sitewide and subreddit rules.   Please note that the Reddit sitewide guidelines on selfpromotionhttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion still apply.  ___   General Rules   No personal attacks   Namecalling, adhominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other users are not allowed. Users who break this rule may have their comments removed with a warning or ban.   No extreme content   r/furry_irl is a public forum with a wide variety of users with different tastes. We kindly ask our users to refrain from submitting or linking extreme or questionable content.   For more information on which kinds of content are considered extreme, please consult the full rules page/r/furry_irl/wiki/ruleswiki_no_extreme_content.   No hate speech   Posts and comments using words or phrases that may be harmful are subject to removal, including but not limited to racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic or transphobic slurs. Malicious use of hate speech is grounds for a ban without warning.  Do not threaten, advocate for, or celebrate, violence, harm physical or otherwise, or the death of others. This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behaviour may be subject to a permanent ban.  Please also do not mention specific hate subreddits in comments or in the content of posts. Posts and comments containing hate subreddit names will be removed.   No politics   Do not post submissions or make comments that deal with overtly political topics, feature politicians or other related people, or push for a particular political agenda.   furry_irl is a meme subreddit; political content is inappropriate, and out of the scope of the topics we cover here.   Give source   Our users are strongly encouraged to provide a source for artwork and intellectual property used in their submissions. The moderation team reserves the right to remove submissions and comments to content that is misappropriated or rehosted without the consent of the original artist.   Don’t spam  submit quality, not quantity  Please be considerate towards your fellow furs and refrain from submitting too many posts a day. 3 posts a day is the max.  Submission Rules   All posts must be titled “furry_irl”   Titles can contain any single one, real, SFW word, of at most 14 characters, followed by one nonalphanumeric character multicharacter emojis are supported, followed by the letters "irl".  Posts must stand on their own without the title to explain them. If your post doesn't make sense if it is named "furry_irl" it will be removed. If in doubt or it gets auto removed, title your post "furry_irl".   All posts must relate to furries or furry culture   All content must relate to furries or furry culture. Furry memes are posts that are relatable to furries or relate to furry culture in some way. There must be a clear reference to furries, furry culture, or notable people or characters in the furry community.  Posts need to stand on their own; if the fact they are being posted to a furry subreddit is what makes them furry, or if it needs a furry related title to give it furry context, they aren’t furry memes on their own and will be removed.  All posts must be relatable or a meme   Posts that don't have a clearly relatable or meme/joke context will be removed. Refrain from submitting generic furry artwork, photos of unrelated products with vague furry names, blogposts about your life this includes cakeday posts, animal pictures or gifs that belong better in any of the other hundreds of animal themed subs on Reddit, etc.  Direct image/video/GIF links only.   Because this is primarily an image browsing content subreddit, links to websites even elsewhere on Reddit will be removed. Please only post links to images, gifs and videos. If you would like to post something about an article or somewhere else on Reddit, take a screenshot and post that per all other rules.  Videos must be shorter than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Use timestamps to skip ahead in a video to only share the relevant part.  Censor Reddit usernames   All usernames from Reddit accounts must be blurred or covered. You do not need to block out your own username if you are in the screenshot.  Tag NSFW content   furry_irl is a primarily SFW subreddit. Please be liberal with marking content as NSFW, including when images are cropped.   If your post contains depictions of actual genitalia or explicit sex acts or scenes, it additionally has to be flaired as “actual yiff.”  It is better to be safe than sorry; tag your post as NSFW if you’re not sure.  Common reposts and overdone topics will be removed   Please avoid posting common or recent posts. We also maintain a list of overdone topics that will be subject to removal:  Chat screenshots  owo/621 posts and any other common furry terminology  "Fragile heterosexuality" memes  "Antifur" bashing/circlejerking  The cheese grater  Nonfurry Youtubers and other entertainment figures  Memes urging others to repost e.g. "Repost or he/she will show up in your room".

t5_2rlnw;redditrequest;This subreddit is for requesting moderation privileges for an abandoned subreddit or to remove an inactive top mod from a subreddit you currently moderate.

The current review time for requests is 6 days. Updated 12 October  To request a subreddit, submit a posthttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/submit by linking to the subreddit in question. If the top mod of a subreddit you moderate is still active on the site, please use this process insteadhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal.  Please read before posting  Requesters:  + Your account must be at least 90 days old and have at least 500 post/comment karma to request a subreddit. Awarder and awardee karma do not count towards this total.   + Automod will respond to every request, but sometimes a request will be missed by the bot. If there is no message after a couple of days, it has automatically been moved to manual review. Please do not delete your request if there is no comment.  + When a request is made, an automatic message will be sent to the mods of that sub asking them to respond to the request. We allow a 5 day grace period for moderators of requested subreddits to receive and respond to this message. This timeframe should not be taken as an indication of when you can expect a response to your request.  Moderators:  + If you already mod a subreddit whose top moderator is inactive across Reddit and wish to remove your top mod, post a link to your subreddit and put the name of the mod you’re wanting to remove in the subject line.  + If you already moderate a subreddit that has a top moderator who is inactive in your subreddit but active elsewhere on Reddit, you will need to use the top mod removal process herehttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal.  + If you are already the moderator of a subreddit that was banned due to lack of moderation and would like to appeal that ban, please contact r/modsupport via modmail instead of r/redditrequest.   + To be considered an active mod, you must be actively moderating your subreddit.   + If there has been no activity on your account in the last 30 days, you will be considered inactive. Solely logging in does not count as activity.   + When a request has been made, you will receive a message from request_bot linking you to the modmail message from the user who is requesting the subreddit.   + If you would like to continue moderating this subreddit you must reply in the comments of the request within 5 days. Failure to do so will result in the subreddit being eligible for reddit request.   + You must have valid reasons when denying the request and explain to the requester and us why you want to keep the subreddit. We want to ensure that subreddits are being held onto with the right intentions for growth. Responding to requests will decrease the number of people who believe the subreddit is unmoderated. Please note that responding with a simple "no" is not considered a valid reason.   + If you would like to add the mod to your team you can find instructions on how to do that herehttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq.  Rules  + You may only request one subreddit every 15 days. Choose wisely.  Multiple requests will be auto removed.  + If a subreddit has been banned in the last 30 days and has over 2.5K subscribers, it is not eligible for request and will be denied. Anything under 2.5K will be reviewed in the normal timeframe.    + Accounts less than 90 days old and without at least 500 combined post/comment karma will not be approved subreddits.  + You may not use multiple accounts to request subreddits.  + You may not request subreddits on behalf of other users.  + Before requesting a subreddit, you must send a message to the subreddit’s modmail stating your intentions for the subreddit. Please link to this message in your post. Failure to do so will result in a denial. Exceptions will be made to this rule if the sub is banned, private, or there are no mods listed.  + The exact criteria used in evaluating requests is left to admin discretion but can include, sitewide bans in the last 90 days, not having enough mod experience, no relevant karma for the requested subreddit or if the majority of your karma is from freekarma subs etc. More info can be found in our FAQhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faqwiki_why_was_my_request_denied.3F.  + Multiple people can request the same subreddit, though requests are reviewed in a chronological order. If you are receiving an error when requesting a subreddit that has already been requested please refer to the FAQhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faqwiki_why_is_it_saying_that_my_link_has_already_been_submitted.3F.  + Please do not ask for an exemption from the rules.  + Requests can take up to 4 weeks to be reviewed, so please be patient.   Additional information may be found in the FAQhttp://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq  This is an adminsponsored subreddit.

Remember the human. Refrain from hostile or badfaith arguments, as well as otherwise uncivil behavior. This rule applies equally to all members of the community.  Rule 2  Don't discriminate against groups of people. Do not glorify violence towards other people or engage in/support bigotry or bigoted stances. This includes supporting racist, homophobic, or transphobic stances, as well as targeted harassment towards any other group of people.  Rule 3  Avoid making personal insults.  To maintain the quality of discussions, avoid making personal insults  this includes unproductive or vitriolic criticisms of others, especially aspects of others unrelated to the discussion at hand.    3a  In the context of the development direction of DDA, this includes rude or badfaith criticism of gameplay features. Constructive criticism of the game, or even better, contributing to the game directly, is encouraged instead.  Rule 4  No reposts from within a month. To preserve the quality of posts or memes within the subreddit, reposts within a month of a previous post will be removed at moderator discretion.  Rule 5  Provide context for image posts. For image posts, especially Story posts or Bug posts, explain or otherwise clarify the context of a post in either the title or a toplevel comment in the post.   Rule 6  Avoid making offtopic posts. This should be selfexplanatory. Sufficiently offtopic comments will be removed at moderator discretion as well.  Rule 7  Avoid excessive selfadvertisement. Selfadvertisement of content related to CDDA should be limited to one post every two weeks at maximum. Selfadvertisement posts may be removed at moderator discretion without notice. If you stream CDDA frequently, consider requesting a place in the Weekly Questions thread.

t5_2qs1t;newyorkcity;The Alternative subreddit for New York City!

Welcome to r/NewYorkCity! Your thoughts and opinions matter here, so feel free to subscribe and participate!   Rules:  1.	Posts must be related to New York City which includes all five boroughs, not just Manhattan.  2.	No blatant or distasteful selfpromoting of your own blog/social media/killer app/business. Obvious spammers and repeat offenders will be permabanned. However, if you have some quality original content to post, you may tastefully link to a source in the comments.  3.	No sharing of personal information, doxxing, or witch hunts. No sharing private photos or videos of others taken without consent. Offenders will be permabanned.  4.	ABSOLUTELY NO ADVOCATING/INCITING VIOLENCE! Being a dick is fine we're New Yorkers after all but using language that is abusive or discriminatory will not be tolerated, and will result in a permaban.  5.	Your account must be older than 24 hours to submit and comment. This is to prevent spam.  6.	No Polls or Surveys: This is not /r/SampleSize.  7.	Respect Laws: This is not the place to sell/buy drugs, prostitutes, guns/weapons, or other contraband. Attempting to do so will result in a permaban.  8.	News Articles: Only one article per news event articles with new information are exempt. Post title must match linked article headline.   9.	Political posts are allowed, but must have a nonleading title. Posts about events for a specific candidate or political issue are allowed, as are posts intended to foster discussion about political issues/candidates. For Example: "Don't forget to vote Yes on Prop X" or "Vote for Y Candidate" are not allowed. "Rally for Y Candidate on Date" is allowed. "What do you think about Prop X?" is allowed.  10.	PHOTOGRAPHY ONLY ALLOWED ON WEEKENDS! Weekday photo posts will be removed. When you do post your photos, please only post one each weekend day. No spamming your entire camera roll. Artwork and historical photos are permitted during weekdays.  11.    Limit Submissions to No More than Two 2 per 24 Hour Period. Unless if it’s something that has to be mentioned or shared  and  you believe it’s absolutely necessary, please limit your submissions to no more than two per 24 hour period. It’s alright to share one submission, or two, but it’s excessive to share 3 or more per 24 hour period, which at that point will be removed as spam  and  action taken. This is implemented in order to not have certain users inundate the subreddit with their content, and give others a chance to share content.

Q I don't understand the majority of the posts, what are people referencing?   A  In the early 2000's Ricky, Steve and Karl worked on a radio show called Xfm. From there they went on to do podcasts. Most posts will be about Xfm, which are available almost everywhere!    Q Have the trio split up?

t5_2qmsf;Hair;Welcome to the /r/hair community! This community is all about hair and beauty.

      GENERAL RULES Updated 11/2021   Use constructive criticism   do not put others down. Please try to follow reddiquettehttp://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette when possible.     All posts have to be related to hair. SFW only   Spam will not be tolerated.    For style advice and product recommendations, please be sure to include the type of hair you have and condition it's in, as well as the whole overall look you are trying to accomplish. For color advice: include things like whether or not the hair has been dyed before, and if so with what and how many times, and a picture! If you're not comfortable using your own picture, we would advise for you to use a celebrity hair color or style picture when describing a desired style, at least, for better advice! We highly suggest using imgur.comhttp://imgur.com to upload images.   If you don't know how to describe a haircut to the stylist then take the picture to him/her. It's always much better than explaining.         tldr; have respect for yourself and others, and don't spam.  If you feel your entry was unfairly removed or you were unfairly blocked, please contact a moderator.  PLEASE don't hold it against the mods if your post is not posted  it's probably just stuck in the spam filter and we missed it. If you bring it to our attention we will hunt for it.

This is a subreddit for the classic 80's penandpaper roleplaying game Cyberpunk 2020, the second edition of the even classicer Cyberpunk, and also the more popular one.  Prior to posting or commenting, apply some chipware filled with our Rules wiki pagehttps://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk2020/wiki/index.  If you have a question, why not RTFM on our FAQ pagehttps://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk2020/wiki/faq?  CP2020 is an RPG based on the idea of "style over substance" and other ridiculously 80's concepts. It is much more skillfocused than levelfocused, unlike many more mainstream RPGs, and its battle system is based around making fast, highrisk decisions, as even a single poor shot can lay your character low.

t5_3l98x;gachagaming;A friendly place for fans and players to celebrate all sorts of gacha games. All players welcome, all games welcome. Be excellent to each other.

 Rules  Please familiarize yourself with the ruleshttps://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules of our community before you post.  1. 1\. Respect others.      1. Treat your peers with respect. Don't harass them and don't be toxic toward them regardless of their gacha choice, unit choice, spending habits, or other unrelated reasons including, but not limited to, race and sexuality.     2.  and nbsp;      3. Additionally, you are required to follow the reddiquettehttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette.  2. 2\. All threads must be related to gacha gaming.      1. Everything you post here must be relevant or connected in some way to gacha gaming.  3. 3\. Use Megathreads when applicable.      1. It is unnecessary to make a new post when looking for new games to play, simply use the daily Megathread https://old.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/search?q=flair%3AMegathread+HELP+ME+FIND+A+GAME and restrict_sr=on and sort=new and t=all for that. This includes posting a list of games and asking which to play.     2.  and nbsp;     3. For new game releases, common questions like "How is  Game ?" should be asked in the Release Megathread for a week after game release. Posts related to game with important enough content can still be posted outside the Megathread based on moderator discretion.  4. 4\. Don't post banned content. See rule details for list      1. Images and videos from the "Gacha Life" series of games. Post in r/GachaUnity or r/GachaLifevideos instead.     2. Pointing out bad mobile game ads.     3. Summons or "brag" posts, videos and/or pictures.     4. Links to redirection or aggregation sites.     5. Referral codes.     6. Giving, buying, selling or trading accounts or any other merchandise.     7. Information related to breaking Terms of Services.     8. Fanart.     9. Drama/Scandal Posts, unless directly related to a gacha game or company.     10. Posts asking for emulator recommendations.  5. 5\. No loweffort content.      1. Posts that do not contribute to a discussion do not need their own thread. No oneliners or posts that have for sole purpose to bait, flex or spam.  6. 6\. Use the PROMO tag in the title of your post when promoting content.      1. If you are linking to a YouTube channel, Twitch channel, Discord server, forum, website or any other content that you are promoting, use the PROMO tag.     2.  and nbsp;     3. Limitations:     4.  and nbsp;     5.  One promo every 2 days maximum if you contribute in the sub regularly.     6.  One promo per week if you do not contribute in the sub.  7. 7\. Use the correct flair.      1. All posts are required to have an appropriate flair attached to them in order to keep the subreddit organized.  8. 8\. Safe for work content only.      1. Gacha games tend to be a touch heavy on sexuality and sometimes, on violence too. Things you would normally see on a regular gacha game are fine here. But, if the content of your post is outright nudity, sexuality or extreme violence, then it is not welcome here.  9. 9\. Do not submit posts that better belong in their gamespecific subreddits.      1. Posts that better belong in their gamespecific subreddits will be removed. This includes but is not limited to:     2.  and nbsp;          Who to Reroll?          Help in  game           Guild Recruiting          Inane news          Gamespecific memes     9. Some exceptions to this rule include:     10.  and nbsp;          General Game Discussion/Inquiries          Notable news eg. Collabs, Anniversary, Major Events              If news is not obviously notable eg. Some event PVs fall into this category, we recommend adding a summary explaining its importance.  10. 10\.

t5_2qhqw;futurama;Welcome to the wooorld of tomorrowww!  Have you ever tried simply closing out of reddit, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Welcome to the subreddit of tomorrow!    Be sure to follow our rules and posting guidelines:   Submissions and memes should have some direct relationship to Futurama; relating it to the show through the title is insufficient. Some meme templates use Futurama characters, but the actual meme in that case must be about Futurama.  No submissions concerning modern politics  No Disenchantment content  No pictures of things that remind you of Roberto  No pictures of various lengths of wire  Be civil  Site ruleshttps://www.redditinc.com/policies/contentpolicy also apply   Check out r/ImaginaryNewNewYork for loads of fan art!   Spoiler code if you need it:  \Spoilers "I.C. Weiner" will appear as:  Spoilers "I.C. Weiner"

This is /r/Jeopardy!https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/ A community for discussing Jeopardy! episodes, news, strategy, and appreciation.   Rules  Please note that in case of any discrepancies between these and the rules listed in New Reddit, the New Reddit rules take precedence.  1. All posts about the current day's game must be in the game thread before 11 PM Eastern. The show airs at different times around North America; please don't ruin the fun of the show for others.  Please also be mindful of spoilers for those who do DVR the show. Blatant spoilers in post titles may also be removed after this at moderator discretion.  2. Do not violate nondisclosure agreements regarding the show.  Anyone who knows the outcome of future games—contestants, families, audience members, staff—should keep it to themselves. Reddit is a public forum; Jeopardy staff and Sony legal could monitor the subreddit for violations of the nondisclosure agreements.  If an episode has not yet aired in the continental United States, it may not be discussed in any way on this subreddit.  3. Be excellent to contestants and community members. Keep the discussions civil. It's fine to disagree or criticize but no name calling or insults will be tolerated. Be excellent toward your fellow community members and toward Jeopardy! contestants. Absolutely no obvious bigotry will be tolerated. That includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc. You will be immediately permabanned, without warning.  4. Do not request or post video links to episodes.  Due to copyright laws, Jeopardy content from unofficial or unlicensed sources cannot be tolerated and shall be deleted on sight.  This includes asking where you can find archived episodes.  Any clips of the show must be posted from Jeopardy.com or one of the official Jeopardy social media channels.  Posts or comments that encourage piracy may result in a ban without prior warning.  5. No parody or joke accounts. Do not impersonate a contestant on this subreddit. Posts or comments which contain patently incorrect information regarding the show's procedures will also be removed, so as not to mislead future contestants.  6. If you are thinking about submitting a post about a topic that links substantively outside of this subreddit, and the material is yours, please message the moderators first before posting. Permission must have been explicitly granted before the post is permitted. This is especially true in case of any projects you may wish to share on the subreddit, as we can often provide you with further context and assistance before posting.  Please keep in mind that contestants past, present, and future often lurk in and occasionally contribute to this subreddit.  Contestants are eligible for special "flair" next to their username.

Please look here before submitting Question posts.  Flair guidehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/flairguide   Breakdown of purpose and use of subreddit’s flairs.  Subreddit's rules  1 Be relevant to Undertale or Deltarune   Keep your posts on topic! Posts discussing/sharing content about Undertale AUs, Deltarune AUs, or the subreddit itself are also permitted. If the connection to UT/DR is too tenuous, the post may be removed under this rule as well.  2 No sexual or otherwise obscene content   Do not share or discuss content that is more sexually suggestive or obscene than the game itself.  3 No bootleg merchandise and pirated content   Don't promote the kinds of merchandise that Toby is not okay with. Details herehttps://undertale.tumblr.com/post/139726155020/changingpolicyonfanmerch  Discussions of piracy and attempts of illegal distribution of the game are not allowed. Additionally, since there is no official port of Undertale to mobile devices, most of the available ones count as piracy too. As such do not discuss or share screenshots of these versions here.  4 No soliciting   Do not ask users to participate in anything that is not Undertalebased.  Do not pit us against outsiders.  Do not post about upvotes.  Unless you are looking for help with fan project related to Undertale, please don't make posts that are just invitation to subreddit or discord  Low effort linking to streams, or let’s plays is not allowed unless the stream is of special occasion charity, some event…, or if the video is of higher production value  5 Sharing art and fanworks   While sharing any form of fan work, tag your post with the appropriate flair distinguishing it as either OC or Found creation or My / Found meme art. If the creation isn’t yours, name the artist in the title or link them in comments. Ideally both.  Unless it's a wellknown meme format, you must properly credit art used in memes and other post types.  Redraws, comic dubs, covers of fan made songs or translations can be flaired as OC, but you have to clarify it in the title and provide a link to the original.  Full version of the rule + how to track down art sources can be found herehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/unsourced  6 Etiquette   Remember the human on the other side of the screen and treat them with respect.  Slurs, brigading and bigotry of any kind won’t be tolerated, regardless of the context.  Being sharper with your words at times is fine, but don't overdo it.  Posts and comments must be in English.  7 Avoid reposts   Posts identical or nearly identical to recent submissions recent being 6 months will be removed as reposts,  Exceptions to the 6 month rule are reposts of the top 100 posts and content you have already submitted, meaning they cannot be reposted even after 6 months have passed.   8 Avoid low effort posts  For post to be considered low effort, two requirements must be fulfilled:   The post was visibly sewed together quickly and there’s little to no effort on display.  It falls directly under or is in spirit of if your post is too similar to one of the listed formats, mods reserve the right to remove it as low effort one the formats listed herehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/low_effort  9 Spoilers and Content policies  Currently, these are the addional requirements post's content must abide:   Posts asking questions which are answered in FAQ wiki page will be removed.  No rapid posting 3+ posts in a span of an hour, space your submissions more or use picture galleries.  Discussion, art and inclusion in polls of frans and similar aged up ships is not allowed on post level.  You can modmail us with any concerns.https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FUndertale  Additional links  Official merchandisehttps://www.fangamer.com/collections/undertale  Related subredditshttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/relatedsubs  Making dialogue boxeshttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/boxes  Subreddit credits and contributorshttps://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/top_contributors   /RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible

t5_2xs5t;ModernMagic;A subreddit dedicated to the discussion of Magic: The Gathering's Modern format!

 Subreddit Ruleshttp://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/wiki/rules  This subreddit is for players of any level of experience to discuss any topics regarding the Modern format, whether it is decks that pro's have been winning with, metagame discussion, card discussion, or home brews. Please do not try and sell cards or decks within this subreddit.  All we ask is that before you post, do some research yourself to try to find the answer to your query. It can be as simple as typing your query into google, along with the word Reddit, to see if your question has been asked before.    When posting deck lists, it is generally preferred that you link to a deck building site such as tappedout.net or something similar. Please, make sure you include a description of what your deck is, what it intends to do, and specific questions that stimulate conversation. People are not here to critique the brew you slapped together with zero thought. Try to do some metagame testing to get a feel for your deck so you can talk about it better.

t5_2raed;creepy;All things Creepy!

Don't be rude.   New to reddit? Click here!https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddit_101  Join our Discord!https://discord.gg/pYDygHh   In addition to reddit's global rules, /r/creepy enforces the following:     1\. NOT CREEPY DON'T POST IT! Insufficiently creepy submissions will be removed at moderator's discretion. Generally speaking, if it can work as a post on a comedy or a cute subreddit, it doesn't belong here. Abandoned buildings without a creepy context will be directed elsewhere.     If a post is completely off topic, please report the post and message the mods.http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy  2\. Do NOT complain "That's not creepy!" in the comments or in post titles. Defamation of the subreddit itself and those who disregard the sidebar rules will be banned permanently. As a counterbalance against rule 2, keep in mind that different people are creeped out by different things, and suspension of disbelief helps the atmosphere. Just downvote and move on, or upstage them by submitting something even creepier.http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/submit "You know you want to." You'll notice the loudest complainers never actually submit anything good themselves. The health of any subreddit depends on users like you submitting quality content and the community voting wisely.  3\. No pictures of costumes, makeup, or children's art. From October 131 there will be a "Halloween Megathread" where the costume rule will be lifted in said thread. However comments will be closely monitored.  4\. No memes, religious discussions, or politics. Post content of that nature in their specific subreddits, this place isn't for comedy it's not a church or a place to discuss politicians.     5\. If your submission is NSFW, use the NSFW tag. If your submission is just gore without a creepy context, please take it to r/WTFhttps://old.reddit.com/r/WTF/   6\. No imgur gallery links!  Instead, use direct imgur image links or album links http://i.imgur.com/EXAMPLE.png or http://i.imgur.com/a/EXAMPLE instead of http://imgur.com/gallery/EXAMPLE, for example as they're easier for mobile and RES users to open.   7\. No Comment Spam. Take the I took an arrow to the knee or hell in a cell comments elsewhere. If you persist with said comments you will receive a 3 day ban as a warning.    If you see any rule violations, please message the modshttp://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy and we'll look into it as soon as possible. Please include a link of the  comment or submission in question, as this makes it much easier for the moderation team to handle the issue.  8\. No Videos Video content belongs in /r/videos that means no YouTube submissions or V.reddit posts. We do however accept Gfycat gifs and Imgur gifs if linked properly.

t5_2uylr;JapanTravel;Got questions? Need advice? Overwhelmed with your itinerary? Want to share your travel tips and experiences in Japan? Then this is the place for you! /r/JapanTravel is for any and all looking to visit Japan as a tourist — including those who have already been.

 Welcome to /r/JapanTravel!
 
 This subreddit is for any and all looking to visit Japan as a tourist — including those who have already been.
 
 READ OUR FAQhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel BEFORE YOU POST.  
 
  Submission Guidelines
 
 1. This subreddit is intended for those traveling as a tourist within Japan. General posts about travel, airlines, accommodations, or other destinations should be posted in r/travel or r/flights. Posts about living in Japan, whether temporarily or permanently belong, in either r/movingtojapan, r/teachinginjapan, or r/japanlife. Translation requests should be posted in r/translator. Posts that belong in other subreddits will be removed or redirected.
 2. Do your homework before you post. Read the FAQ linked above, check out the General Advice pagehttps://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice, search the subreddit, and do a cursory Google search before you submit a question. Easily researched or commonly repeated questions will be removed. This also includes questions about purchasing or using a JR Pass, as the FAQ contains an extensive page on this topic. If you've done your homework but still don't have an answer to your questions, create a descriptive post that includes the research you've done.
 3. No low effort posts. Be specific in the questions you're asking. Include information such as: Where you're starting and your dates of travel; budget; general interests or things you like to do. This information can have a significant impact on the suggestions the community provides to you. Posts that contain minimal information "Where should I go?", excessively broad questions "Tips for Tokyo?" or "Is Osaka worth it?", or other low effort / karmagleaning posts "I miss Japan!" will be removed.
  Itinerary posts must be clearly identified in their titles, and must include more information than dates and location. We are not your travel agents, and it is not the job of the sub to fill the gaps in your itinerary for you. Itinerary posts must have sufficient supporting information and specific questions so that the community can help. Any itinerary post that does not meet these requirements will be removed.
  No self promotion. This includes advertising business services you are directly connected to. If you want to submit your own content, its primary goal should be to drive or jumpstart discussion on r/JapanTravel. A example of this are trip reports that include links to photo albums hosted on a third party site. If the intent of your post is to drive traffic to your blog, vlog, Instagram, portfolio, business etc., your post will be removed and you might be banned.
  Meetup requests for tourists or transient travelers are only allowed in official Mega MeetUp thread stickied at the top of the sub. A new thread is automatically created each month, so please keep meetup related posts limited to the thread that corresponds to the month you'll be visiting Japan.
  No solicitation posts. This includes: souvenir/merchandise purchase requests; accommodation/restaurant booking requests; survey or crowdsourcing requests; event ticket purchasing requests; or location photo/video requests. The only exception to this rule is that we allow ticket resale in the monthly meetup thread only. Posts that violate this rule will be removed.
  No "meta" posts about this sub. ie: "Why do people post the same itineraries all the time?" No PMs to individual mods about removed comments or posts. Problems or questions should be directed to moderators via the mod mail interface.
  Be civil. Harassment of other users or mods, trolling, posting of users' personal information, repeated intentional rule breaking, hijacking another user's thread to complain about concerns with the sub or Mods, or other general unsavory behavior will be met with bans. We take this rule very seriously, and will enact it as necessary to keep up the quality of information in this sub.
  Trip reports and other informative posts are welcome on this subreddit. If you are going to share your experience by writing a trip report, review, guide, or set of tips, please make sure you do so in an organized and detailed fashion. If you want to share external content, such as news reports, these posts should be made as text posts only with any photos or relevant external content linked within the post.
  This sub is PG13 and as such we do NOT allow posts asking about information related to sexual services, illegal drugs, underage drinking, and the like. We also do not allow posts asking how to break or skirt the laws in Japan, including immigration and importation laws. Posts containing those requests or information WILL be removed at a moderator's discretion.

t5_2qs6s;Insurance;All Things Insurance! 

Welcome to r/insurance!  FAQhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/wiki/faq     There is absolutely no solicitation. Doing so will result in an immediate ban.  This includes requesting a poster to contact you privately.     This is a community of insurance professionals and geeks who love the field of insurance.   What is our Goal?     1. To help our fellow redditors with any insurance related questions. Need help with a policy? Confused about your coverages? Want help shopping for insurance? We are here to help you!      2. We are here to share relevant topics to promote insurance knowledge among professionals.   Posting Guidelines   h5greenbox   DO POST:     Reviews, feedback, comments and questions relevant to insurance.       Please include your location, state/country, as insurance differs across borders.       If you post and are unable to see it, please contact the mods. Sometimes the automoderator marks stuff as spam, when it isn't. When submitting a question to the mods, please link to the post in the message so we can easily find it and fix it.     This should go without saying, but you need to be civil. If you disagree with someone, you can express that disagreement but insults and doxing are never permitted. This will result in removal of the comment and could lead to your banning from /r/Insurance .     h6redbox   DO NOT POST:     Absolutely no Solicitation. We have an active mod team, you will be banned. If you are unsure just send us a message about your post. Like almost all of the professional subs, requesting someone to PM you is not allowed.    For requests for financial help. Try /r/assistance    For insurance professionals try /r/insurancepros    For legal advice try /r/legaladvice

t5_2re84;Rateme;A community where you can not only be rated on your appearance but also get tips from awesome Redditors on how to look your best!

   Welcome!          What Does Reddit Look like? How Do I Look? Rateme is the place to find out! r/Rateme is where you can not only be rated on your appearance but also get tips from awesome redditors on how to look your best!           Rules           Rule 1: Include your Age and Gender in the title. Example: M25 or 27F.  Nonbinary or nongender conforming posters may say so in their title.  No one may harass trans posters for identifying as a gender other than their biological sex.      Rule 2: You must be 18 years old or older to submit content.          Rule 3: Please use imgurhttp://www.imgur.com, or upload the images directly to reddit, for all images posted to the subreddit.  Do not click the green "Share to Community" button on Imgur. Doing so will allow unwanted Imgur users apart from this subreddit to view and comment on your album. You don't want that!             Rule 4: Do not share or request personal information of any kind.          Rule 5: Offer constructive advice to other users. Be polite and courteous to other users. Insults, personal attacks, lewd comments, or trolling will not be tolerated. If you receive an offensive comment on your post, click the "Report" button under that comment. The moderator team will be alerted and take appropriate action.            Rule 6: This is a Safe For Work community. Nudity or sexually suggestive content is not allowed. Please mark any shirtless or revealing photos as NSFW.              Rule 7: Photos submitted to the subreddit must be your own.               Rule 8         All submissions must include a photo verifying the consent of the person being rated. Please include at least one photo in your submission of you holding a handmade sign with your exact reddit username. All posts are manually approved by a moderator.             Tips For Posting   Submit a link post!  Upload through Imgur,http://www.imgur.com and submit it to Reddit! Again, Do not click the green "Share to Community"  button on Imgur. Doing so will allow unwanted Imgur users apart from this subreddit to view and comment on your album. You don't want that!    Tell us a little bit about yourself, and post more than one picture. You can add a comment to your post if you're looking for anything specific.    What you consider your 'good picture' might be less attractive to others, and what you think looks terrible might actually be flattering. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, making ratings subjective!    If you see something say something! If you see an offensive comment on another person's post, click the "Report" button under that comment. The mod team will be alerted and take appropriate action.   Don't trust anyone who PMs you as a result of your post with a proposition involving money or soliciting additional pictures.  There are plenty of creeps on Reddit who try to screw people over, but don't feed them, report them.   Limit one post per month unless you've radically changed your look somehow.  Let other people have a turn.   Try providing a clear representative picture of yourself. This means no extreme closeups or crazy filtered pictures.              Check out these other subreddits!    /r/ToastMe      /r/RoastMe  /r/GayRateMe      /r/EqualAttraction    /r/UglyDuckling     /r/amiugly  /r/amisexy

Message the mods with your submission before posting. We reserve the right to remove any blog posts, Twitter chains, podcasts, etc. that do not contribute to the subreddit.  6  Memes are allowed as long as they are relevant to the giants or topics currently on the sub. Memes that don't relate to the giants or sub eg. Trevor Lawrence will be removed.  7 Low effort posts will be removed. Post like "Who should we draft" and "Who should we replace Gettleman with" with no analysis are low effort.  8 When submitting a new post, the title should describe the submission.  The purpose of a title is so people reading it and looking for it will know what they will find inside without any unnecessary clutter. Make sure that your title does that as best as possible by avoiding editorialization, misleading wording, or false titles intended as a joke.

GENERAL POLICIESNothing in our policies makes it OK to be abusive to our members or visitors. /r/Coins is not the wild west, it's a place where civility is appreciated and expected. If you want to browbeat or insult people for perceived infractions please take it somewhere else. Abusive posts will be deleted upon detection without further discussion. Politics and Religion can sometimes have a bearing on the world of coins, but in the interest of avoiding heated offtopic arguments we ask that you avoid those subjects on this subreddit. Let's please try to keep things calm and civil here. Thanks. NEW TO COLLECTING?PLEASE RESIST THE URGE TO CLEAN YOUR COINS IF YOU EVER INTEND TO SELL THEM.R Tarnish on old coins is normal and doesn't usually affect their value, while cleaning can lower it. If your focus is US coins pick up a copy of Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins," published by Whitman. It's full of good information and usually available from the local library. It's an annual publication but older copies are cheap and usually accurate enough for general use.    COIN IDENTIFICATIONBefore submitting a coin ID request please look at the frequently asked about coins on the top of the sidebar. If you'd like help with your coins, but submit low quality photos, request identification of coins easily found online or post more than 10 coins at a time our volunteers may not show much interest in your request. Please set your expectations accordingly. PHOTOGRAPHING COINSUsing a flatbed scanner or a borrowed camera with a macro setting is often better than using the camera on your phone. However, depending on your phone's camera quality, putting a jewelers loupe in front of its lens can produce detailed photos. Please keep your file sizes reasonable and your photos cropped.   USER APPRAISALSWe can't provide exact appraisals of a coin's value, or tell you exactly how much a dealer will pay you for it. Much of that depends on a coin's condition, rarity, and the demand for it  as well as your own ability to negotiate. SELLING AND TRADING COINSWe DO NOT allow posts requesting or offering to buy, sell or trade coins in discussion threads  PLEASE KEEP IT TO PM. No links to Ebay or other sales sites unless it's for an item of general interest that wouldn't profit you directly. If you want to buy, sell or trade your coins please consider posting to /r/PMsForSale, /r/CoinSales, /r/CoinSwap, or /r/CoinExchange.    THE SPAM FILTERWe check for misdirected submissions several times a day. Posts made from new and/or low karma accounts will need to be manually approved. Thanks for your patience.

t5_3deqz;BikiniBottomTwitter;home of the finest spongebob memes and art

actiondescriptionstyleres actiondescriptionmoderator actiondescriptionstylereddit   Welcome to /r/BikiniBottomTwitter, a place to share all of your favorite memes, cosplays, and fan art from our favorite underwater residence, Bikini Bottom!   Bikini Bottom has a unique way of examining the everyday and we're here to showcase that. Whether it's hilarious, wholesome, depressing, or surreal, Bikini Bottom offers relatable commentary that we all can enjoy. If you can't respect that then please take a bus to Rock Bottom.  Special thanks to u/BayonettaBasher!  ________________________________________  THE RULES  1. All posts must be a Spongebob meme. Do not post content just because it features a resident of Bikini Bottom. Fan art and cosplays are allowed. If you want a sub catered to that sort of thing, check out r/Spongebob. As for here, this is for memes and for memes only. We do not consider videos to be memes.  5. ABSOLUTELY NO REPOSTS. Posts must have not been posts in this subreddit before. Use this nifty little tool to determine whether or not your post has already been here.https://reverse.photos/  2. Don't be a dick. No racism against squirrels. No hate speech. No posts about how different Pearl is from her father.  3. Do not put the punchline in the title of the post.  Having a funny picture of a Bikini Bottom resident and using the title as the punchline does not make your post a meme.  4. Do not post really loweffort memes. Using excessively overdone and/or outdated templates, posting something that is excruciatingly unfunny, begging for upvotes, cake days posts, posting something that simply doesn't make any sense... you get the idea.  6. No spamming. More than 4 posts in 24 hours is considered spam.  6. The mods reserve the right to take any action which includes banning users and removing comments that they feel improves the overall quality of this subreddit. Our most basic duty as mods is to keep this sub clean of any bullshit. With that in mind, we will do whatever we have to do in order to uphold that responsibility. How's that for a little transparency?

t5_2s8e9;frugalmalefashion;The place for coupons, discounts, sales, and deals when it comes to male fashion. Visit the Wiki for more information regarding guides, stores, and tailoring help.

 Rules:   1.Comments on Frugality.  Comments and posts about lack of frugality aren't allowed. Frugality is unique to the individual. It does not refer to the final cost, value, quality, or popularity of the item. Violations of this rule are an automatic 7 day ban.  2.Questions/Singleuse codes  To encourage the sharing of deals and sales, we limit the number of posts that aren't directly related to a sale or deal.  Click here to visit the Simple Questions and OneTime Use code sticky.https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/about/sticky?num=2 Click here to visit the Buy/Sell/Trade sticky.https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/about/sticky?num=1 Violations of this rule are an automatic 1 day ban.   3.No Referral Links/Codes  While we encourage sharing of discount codes and unique links to awesome deals, we discourage users from sharing their own referral links and codes for which they profit from. This removes the incentive of profit for redditors who post and comment within r/frugalmalefashion and keeps the community fair, honest, and ethical.   When money is involved, you cannot trust anyone to be objective, particularly on the internet. Violations of this rule are an automatic 1 day to permanent ban.  4.No misleading links   Do not spam or mislead users. This includes coercion with deceiving links and fake websites.  5.Follow Reddiquette   We strictly enforce reddiquette in r/frugalmalefashion. Click here to visit the official Reddiquette pagehttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette. Healthy debate and sharing of information requires a civil environment, so consider the following:  Remember the human.  Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.  Use an "innocent until proven guilty" mentality.  State your reason for any editing of posts.  6.No astroturfing    Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. To maintain honest and fair posts, do not pose as a third party to a company or a deal/sale if you are directly or indirectly affiliated with a company. If you are directly affiliated, such as an employee, shareholder, owner, or related to any of the above, you must disclose it.   7.New Accounts  and  Karma     For new users, we require a certain minimum amount of karma before posting new threads. By doing so, we are able to filter out a large number of spam posts from bots to spamfilled websites. If you believe your post is legitimate yet still removed, the moderators will review the post, potentially allow it, and monitor it for suspicious activity.    8.No company posts    Posting as a company, even if you announce it, will result in a permanent ban as that is considered spam. Similar to the rules on astroturfing and referral links, we strictly enforce a nonbiased and ethical subreddit, where money isn't exchanged to our subreddit or our members.  9.Title must include discount    To improve the ability to scroll and quickly read deals, we ask that redditors include this information in their post title if possible or applicable.  10.No previously posted sales    To cut back on multiple posts sharing the same information, we require posts to only contain new information on deals. You may create a new post for the following:  New items added to a previously posted deal.  More percentage off to a previously posted deal. Typically, sales run 37 days but can run as long as 2 weeks, so please check the post history that far to see if your deal has been posted already.  11.No insignifcant deals/sales   In order to keep posts relevant to as many redditors as possible, and to keep our subreddit clean from spam, we don't allow insignificant deals. Typically, we consider insignificant deals to be those which are a very low discount like perpetual discounts, or rolling sales or items which aren't historically very popular.   12.YMMV Posts  Some deals are only available at specific physical locations, or have very limited stock, e.g. returned items or factory seconds. In this case, use the YMMV flair "Your Mileage May Vary" to indicate that others may not be able to obtain the same deal. YMMV posts must include location and other pertinent details in the title, or they will be removed.  13.NSFW Content  Since a large number of our subscribers view these deals either around friends/family and at work or school, we can't allow NSFW content, and if it is shared, it must be disclosed. Typically, we won't allow this type of content if it's purely NSFW in nature, rather than just happening to be NSFW and related to a deal or sale such as with underwear. This is a bannable offense and we do enforce it.  Ban List     Frugality complaint rule violations: usually 7 days.  Spam: 130 days, depending on the type/severity.  Personal attacks: varies by severity. Usually ~10 days.  Referral codes/affiliate links: 30 days.  Astroturfing/vote manipulation: usually permanent
