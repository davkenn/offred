first saw this beauty and its companion network player HAP-Z1ES driving a pair SS-NA2ES at one of my local Sony stores. The setup sounded amazing and was on par with 5 figures setups I had auditioned. The speakers sadly were discontinued but the player and the amp were still sold, though they had to be backordered. When the Sony store discounted them 25% earlier this month, I’ve decided to pull the trigger on the TA-A1ES. Well, who knows how much longer it’s going to be sold because it’s already discontinued in many countries? The RRP remained the same since its release in 2015, so all in all I paid less than 1400 USD after discount for a brand-new set. \r  \n\r  \nThe unit itself was just slightly larger than my Leak Stereo 130 but it was much heavier at 17 kg. It was a highly biased Class AB design with the first 10-15 watts into 8 ohms as pure class A, hence the weight was not surprising. Very solid build and I liked the minimalistic look, goes well with my Musician Pegasus DAC. Being a somewhat of a Class A, the amp did go quite warm and there was quite a bit of heat vented out from the top vents, but the top front and middle parts were reasonably cool, so I still felt safe to place the Pegasus on top of it.  The Pegasus was connected to the Sony via XLR balanced input. There was no pre-out or sub-out so the amp was connected to the high speaker input of my Cabasse Santorin 21 sub and then the sub connected via high level speaker output to my Comete 40th. \r  \n\r  \nSo how did it sound? Wow, everything sounded immediately much fuller and weightier with a great sense of scale and authority. Classical recordings unsurprisingly benefited the most from the tonal fattening. When sampling Krystian Zimerman’s superb recent recordings of Beethoven’s Piano Concertos, the orchestra sounded much larger and instrument separation was also much better as I could pick out the separate instruments in those opening loud chords of the 5th Concerto. There was also a lot more bass. Well, my previous Leak Stereo 130 was known to have quite a lean bass so no surprise there, but the increase in bass drawn from my sub and the speakers were quite a bit more substantial that I had to adjust the sub down around 30%. Thankfully the tone remained sweet and largely uncolored. Despite the meatier tone, the sound was actually very smooth and pleasant to listen to; I felt comfortable listening to my tracks at louder volume compared to my previous Leak but quieter listening at night was lovely as well. There seemed to be no improvement in soundstage size compared to my Leak, but maybe it was just the limitation of my bookshelf Cometes. \r  \n\r  \nA track that was problematic with my previous Leak was “You and Me” by Sara Watkins from her album “Sun Midnight Sun”. Watkins’ voice was layered with multiple other voices in this track and on my previous Leak there was a noticeable distortion with this that did make this track rather unpleasant to listen to. But with this Sony, the sound remained pure and crystal clear, no more distortion. And I could isolate the different voices singing in it now. The other track I frequently use to test setups was “Bouquet” by Ichiko Aoba. With a good setup this track should sound ethereal, on lesser setups it would be irritating like nails on a chalkboard. My previous Leak sounded perfectly fine with this track, but the Sony infused the sound with more liveliness that made the experience much more enjoyable. The detail retrieval was also a lot better as I could pick out where she took her breaths now. The Sony was also no slouch in rhythm and dynamics. Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason” was a rollicking good time with this Sony and I was tapping my feet along with this.  \r  \n\r  \nWas it a worthwhile purchase? Yes, it is. People online who had it claimed it came close to pure class As from Luxman and Accuphase. I have not auditioned any of those yet so I could not verify those claims, but to my ears this amp sounded better than a few that were 2 or 3 times the price. Yes, I’ve heard the Yamaha AS-2200 and the equivalent Teac but I still enjoyed the Sony more. I got my money worth, for less than 2x of what I paid for my leak, the sonic improvement to my setup was much more than I expected. TA-A1ES is a special amp, and it really is a pity that Sony could not put more effort into marketing their hi-fi products. If you could still locate a brand-new set better get it before it disappeared completely from the market.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t1_iaom3yd","is_submitter":true,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first saw this beauty and its companion network player HAP-Z1ES driving a pair SS-NA2ES at one of my local Sony stores.

It was a highly biased Class AB design with the first 10-15 watts into 8 ohms as pure class A, hence the weight was not surprising. Very solid build and I liked the minimalistic look, goes well with my Musician Pegasus DAC. Being a somewhat of a Class A, the amp did go quite warm and there was quite a bit of heat vented out from the top vents, but the top front and middle parts were reasonably cool, so I still felt safe to place the Pegasus on top of it.  The Pegasus was connected to the Sony via XLR balanced input. There was no pre-out or sub-out so the amp was connected to the high speaker input of my Cabasse Santorin 21 sub and then the sub connected via high level speaker output to my Comete 40th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how did it sound? Wow, everything sounded immediately much fuller and weightier with a great sense of scale and authority. Classical recordings unsurprisingly benefited the most from the tonal fattening. When sampling Krystian Zimerman’s superb recent recordings of Beethoven’s Piano Concertos, the orchestra sounded much larger and instrument separation was also much better as I could pick out the separate instruments in those opening loud chords of the 5th Concerto. There was also a lot more bass. Well, my previous Leak Stereo 130 was known to have quite a lean bass so no surprise there, but the increase in bass drawn from my sub and the speakers were quite a bit more substantial that I had to adjust the sub down around 30%. Thankfully the tone remained sweet and largely uncolored. Despite the meatier tone, the sound was actually very smooth and pleasant to listen to; I felt comfortable listening to my tracks at louder volume compared to my previous Leak but quieter listening at night was lovely as well. There seemed to be no improvement in soundstage size compared to my Leak, but maybe it was just the limitation of my bookshelf Cometes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A track that was problematic with my previous Leak was “You and Me” by Sara Watkins from her album “Sun Midnight Sun”. Watkins’ voice was layered with multiple other voices in this track and on my previous Leak there was a noticeable distortion with this that did make this track rather unpleasant to listen to. But with this Sony, the sound remained pure and crystal clear, no more distortion. And I could isolate the different voices singing in it now. The other track I frequently use to test setups was “Bouquet” by Ichiko Aoba. With a good setup this track should sound ethereal, on lesser setups it would be irritating like nails on a chalkboard. My previous Leak sounded perfectly fine with this track, but the Sony infused the sound with more liveliness that made the experience much more enjoyable. The detail retrieval was also a lot better as I could pick out where she took her breaths now. The Sony was also no slouch in rhythm and dynamics. Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason” was a rollicking good time with this Sony and I was tapping my feet along with this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it a worthwhile purchase? Yes, it is. People online who had it claimed it came close to pure class As from Luxman and Accuphase. I have not auditioned any of those yet so I could not verify those claims, but to my ears this amp sounded better than a few that were 2 or 3 times the price. Yes, I’ve heard the Yamaha AS-2200 and the equivalent Teac but I still enjoyed the Sony more. I got my money worth, for less than 2x of what I paid for my leak, the sonic improvement to my setup was much more than I expected. TA-A1ES is a special amp, and it really is a pity that Sony could not put more effort into marketing their hi-fi products. If you could still locate a brand-new set better get it before it disappeared completely from the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","removal_reason":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"distinguished":null,"associated_award":null,"stickied":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"gildings":{},"unrepliable_reason":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"/r/audiophile/comments/v1v1h4/new_amp_day_sony_taa1es/iaom3yd/","subreddit_type":"public","locked":false,"report_reasons":null,"created":1654016846,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"link_id":"t3_v1v1h4","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/audiophile","controversiality":0,"depth":0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":15}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmiy","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"audiophile","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmiy","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"audiophile","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qmiy","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"audiophile","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"iaoxi77","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"winged_creature","can_mod_post":false,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_iaox063","score":4,"author_fullname":"t2_2nchwe2h","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I
